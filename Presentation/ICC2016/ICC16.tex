	\item Next, we characterize the variations due to channel estimation in the estimation parameters in terms of their pdfs.
	\item We further characterize the aforementioned variations, which include the interference received at PR and expected throughput at SR in terms of their cdf.
	\item We utilize these cdfs to obtain the expression estimation-sensing-throughput tradeoff.

\begin{itemize}
\item The performance of cognitive radio as hybrid systems is investigated from a deployment perspective.
\item It is argued that channel knowledge is absolutely mandatory for the performance characterization.
\item In view of this, an analytical framework that incorporates channel estimation and subsequently captures the effect of imperfect channel knowledge is established.
\item More importantly, a fundamental tradeoff between the estimation, the sensing time and secondary throughput is determined.
\item In future, it will be interesting to include the effect of channel fading on the performance of the hybrid systems.
