	\pnote{The feasibility of these requirements can be envisaged through the application of some of the promising approaches such as maximizing the spatial degree of freedom, small cell densification, waveform design, in-band full duplex communications.}
\pnote{Despite the existence of these promising technologies, this large number in data rate cannot be achieved without an extension to already allocated spectrum}
\pnote{Now, the question arises, where to look for spectrum, In this perspective, two alternatives exists: traditional approach is below 6 GHz. Due to the static allocation of the spectrum below 6 GHz to different mobile services, it is difficult spectrum below 6 GHz.}
\pnote{Another alternative is to shift to higher frequencies beyond 6 GHz, which corresponds to mm-W and visible light communications}
\pnote{Certainly, the spectrum above 6 GHz is prone to higher propagations loss, limited to LOS propagation, thus mobility of wireless systems is compromised.}
\pnote{A second alternative is utilize the spectrum below 6 GHz more efficiently, by opening the spectrum for secondary usage}

\pnote{Since, we are talking about the 5G systems, it is useful to consider a scenario, where cognitive radio finds its application}
\pnote{A comprehensive incorporation of CR system in a preliminary 5G architecture in the form of CSC is illustrated.} 
\pnote{A CSC is a network entity that enable CR communications for the devices operating indoor.}
\pnote{In order to enhance the viability of the proposed architecture, some essential ingredients are highlighted}
\pnote{The architecture presented comprises of following network elements, MC-BS, MSs as a part of the CSC and MC, CSC-BS.}
\pnote{Next, different spectrum access schemes, pertaining to proposed 5G architecture, are presented. Wireless backhaul link represents a link between MC-BS and CSC-BS (representing a control and data plane). Following the trends, the mm-Wave, visible light communications and exclusively acquired spectrum are the potential candidates in support of wireless backhaul communications.}
\pnote{Direct link corresponds to the conventional link that already exist between the MC-BS and MS. The spectrum for the direct access correspond to conventional link.} 
\pnote{Indirect link corresponds to the CR communications, a spectrum is acquired for secondary usage is utilized for indoor communications.} 
\pnote{Next, it is worthy to understand that why an indoor deployment is proposed for disposition of CR techniques. From a market survey, it has been revealed that 70\% of the data traffic is originated indoor, thus by deploying CSC one attempts to consolidate these traffic sources. Besides, the indoor deployment provides a spatial separation between licensed and unlicensed users.}

\subsection{Performance Analysis}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[t]{Performance Analysis of CR System}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\pnote{Performance analysis in context to wireless system has two main objectives: Firstly, It help us understand the feasibility of a wireless system in real or close to real conditions. Secondly, it allows us to determine the performance limits.} 
\pnote{Coexistence of different wireless systems has always been a difficult task, the task becomes even more challenging if we take into account the fact that two different systems (which may differ in their communication standards) coexists, i.e., share a band of spectrum, separated in time, space or polarization.}
\pnote{With no concrete guidelines on what are prospective primary systems (although there exists certain use cases, but are applicable to specific specific scenarios). From a physical layer perspective, it becomes difficult on how to choose the primary user signal in order to extract some information about the primary system.} 
\pnote{Ofcourse, assinging a dedicated curcuitory to every primary user signal is unrealistic from a deployment perspective. As a result, only solutions will persist that consider no knowledge of primary user signals, for instance energy detection. In other words, versatile and applicable to large range of wireless system.}  
\pnote{It is well-know fact that concept of CR has been under discussion over the last 18 years, during this time line several models have been established, characterizing the performance of CR systems. However, due to the complexity of the underlaying scenario, very few are models have been implemented over the hardware. Leaving their performance analysis questionable.}
\pnote{Since we are dealing with two different systems, it is important to jointly quantify their performance. From a physical layer perspective, secondary access to the licensed spectrum can be made possible through the application of CR techniques at the ST. In order to coexist, a CR system guarantee a sufficient protection to the primary system in the form of interference power received at the PR.}
\pnote{On the other end, in order to co-benefit from the secondary access, the CR system guarantees a certain QoE in the form of throughput at the SR} 
\pnote{It is been determined that the performance characterization as-well-as for the feasibility of CR techniques require the knowledge of involved channels. }

	\pnote{The major contributions are summarized as follows:}
	\pnote{From a system design's perspective, it is important to accommodate the channel estimation into the system model. Hence, the system has cope up with the variations induced in the system due to imperfect channel knowledge, at the same time allocate resources for channel estimation}
	\pnote{These variations are captured by means of a stochastic model. Furthermore, a certain amount of time resources are allocated for channel estimation in the secondary user frame structure.} 
	\pnote{With regard to the psychology established in the previous slide, with no knowledge of the primary user signals, we are faced with the challenge of estimating the channels that exists between two different systems. With this situation in hand, conventional estimation techniques are not applicable. Besides, we have to look for techniques that offer versatility towards unknown primary user signals and low complexity.}
	\pnote{ In this regard, a novel estimation technique termed as received-power based estimation is proposed that satisfies the low-complexity and versatility requirements.}
	\pnote{It is an obvious fact that channel estimation will certainly has a detrimental effect on the performance, thereby degrading the performance of CR systems, in terms of uncertainty in the interference caused due to imperfect channel knowledge or variations induced in the system. Secondly, degradation in throughput caused due to the time allocation.} 
	\pnote{In order to regulate uncertainty in interference, new interference constraints are proposed. Secondly, the interplay between the uncertain interference and the secondary throughput is analyzed in terms of performance tradeoffs. These tradeoffs allow us to determine the suitable estimation time that yields the maximum throughput achieved by the CR systems.}
	\pnote{In order to verify the propositions made while establishing the system model, a hardware is deployed using a software-defined platform.}
	\pnote{Finally, a applicability of the proposed framework in realistic conditions is presented by means of a hardware demonstrator}

	\pnote{Corresponding to this approach the following signal model is proposed. The signal received at the ST over the channel $\hpo$ depends on the following hypothesis, the PT is active and PT is inactive}
	\pnote{The signal is received at the SR only under two conditions, wherever there is a misdetection or the condition where no false alarm happens.} 
	\pnote{With reference to the signal model, the performance of the CR system can be jointly characterized in terms of detectors performance, which symbolizes the primary system performance and throughput received at SR}
	\pnote{The detector's performance can be characterized in terms of the detection probability and false alarm probability. Considering the fact that no knowledge concerning the PU signal is available, energy detectors is employed.}

		\begin{itemize}	
			%\item Lack of channel knowledge renders the performance analysis of CR system incomplete 
			% Through adequate analysis and hardware deployment it is justified that 
			\item Channel knowledge is extremely necessary for the realization of CR techniques over the hardware $\Rightarrow$ control interference to primary system
			\item An analytical framework is proposed that characterizes the detrimental effects (time allocation and channel variations) due to channel estimation is proposed 
			\item Finally, the performed analysis does not only provide answers to specific questions related to imperfect channel knowledge, including 
				\begin{itemize} 
				\fs{7}{9}
\item How to counter the uncertain interference induced in different CR systems? \item How to evaluate the performance degradation? \item How to determine the suitable estimation time and suitable sensing time that yields the maximum throughput achieved? \end{itemize}
but also promotes techniques such as 

\begin{itemize} 
\fs{7}{9}
\item implementation of the channel estimation at the secondary system \item energy-based detection and \item received power-based channel estimation \end{itemize} that ultimately encourage hardware feasibility of CR systems
