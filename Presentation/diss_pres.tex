	\pnote{These requirements can be envisioned through the application of some promising approaches such as maximizing the spatial degree of freedom, reducing the size of the cell to enhance spectrum reuse, designing the waveform to increase spectral efficiency, promoting in-band full duplex communications.}
\pnote{Despite the fact that these technologies contribute significantly to an increase in capacity, this large number in data rate cannot be achieved without an extension to already allocated spectrum}
\pnote{Now, the question arises, where to look for spectrum? A conventional approach is to look for spectrum below 6 GHz}
\pnote{Due the static allocation of the spectrum to different mobile services, it is currently facing scarcity.}
\pnote{One possibility is to shift to higher frequencies, which corresponds to mm-W and visible light communications}
\pnote{However, the communication at these frequencies is prone to higher propagation loss and limited to LOS propagation, thus mobility of wireless systems is compromised.}
\pnote{Another alternative is utilize the spectrum below 6 GHz more efficiently by enabling CR communications}
\pnote{In this regard, CR is an agile system that facilitates the efficient usage of the spectrum by enabling secondary access to the licensed spectrum is considered for obtaining additional spectrum}
%\pnote{This work is focussed on providing spectrum extension by promoting CR communications}

\pnote{Since, we are discussing the 5G systems, it is useful to consider a scenario that facilitates a successful incorporation of CR technology in a 5G network}
%\pnote{A comprehensive incorporation of CR system in a preliminary 5G architecture in the form of CSC is illustrated.} 
\pnote{In this regard, a CSC that enables the CR communications for the devices operating indoor is proposed.}
%\pnote{A CSC is a network entity that enable CR communications for the devices operating indoor.}
%\pnote{In order to enhance the viability of the proposed architecture, some essential ingredients are highlighted}
\pnote{The architecture presented comprises of following network elements, MC-BS, MSs as a part of the CSC and MC, CSC-BS.}
%\pnote{Next, different spectrum access schemes, pertaining to proposed 5G architecture, are presented. Wireless backhaul link represents a link between MC-BS and CSC-BS (representing a control and data plane). Following the trends, the mm-Wave, visible light communications and exclusively acquired spectrum are the potential candidates in support of wireless backhaul communications.}
\pnote{The user interface (between the CSC-BS and the MS) represents of the secondary access to licensed spectrum (CR communication)}
\pnote{CSC-BS is connected to the core network via a wireless backhaul that can be realized using mm-Wave communication or visible light communication} 
%\pnote{Direct link corresponds to the conventional link that already exist between the MC-BS and MS. The spectrum for the direct access correspond to conventional link.} 
%\pnote{Indirect link corresponds to the CR communications, a spectrum is acquired for secondary usage is utilized for indoor communications.} 
\pnote{Next, it is worthy to understand that why an indoor deployment is proposed for disposition of CR techniques. From a market survey, it has been revealed that 70\% of the data traffic is originated indoor, thus it is beneficial if we manage to consolidate these traffic sources by CSC deployment.}
\pnote{Besides, the indoor deployment provides a spatial separation between licensed and unlicensed users.}

	\pnote{Now, the performance analysis of CR system are faced with the following challenges}
	\pnote{Here we are dealing with the coexistence of two different systems (which may differ in their communication standards) that share a band of spectrum. It is challenging task to separate them in time, space or polarization.}
	\pnote{With no concrete guidelines that means no knowledge about the prospective primary systems. From a physical layer perspective, this means no knowledge about the primary user signal.} 
	\pnote{Assigning a dedicated circuitry corresponding to every primary user signal is unrealistic from a deployment perspective. In this regard, only solutions persist that consider no knowledge of primary user signals, for instance energy detection}%. In other words, versatile and applicable to large range of wireless system.}  
	\pnote{The concept of CR has been under discussion over the last 18 years, during this time line several models have been established, characterizing the performance of CR systems. However, due to the complexity of the underlying scenario, these models tend to makes assumptions that are feasible over the hardware, (leaving their performance analysis questionable.)}
	\pnote{Secondary access is enabled through the employment of CR techniques at the ST. Through the implementation of these techniques, a CR system guarantees sufficient protection at the PR in the form of interference power received at the PR, a certain QoE in the form of throughput at the SR}

	\pnote{Depending on how secondary access is performed, CR systems are classified as: interweave system, underlay system and overlay system.}
	\pnote{An interweave system enables the coexistence of primary and secondary systems by separating them in temporal domain.} 
	\pnote{In this regard a spectrum sensing is employed to detect the presence and absence of primary user signal.} %Hence, an interference is avoided by not transmitting the signal wherever the primary signal is detected}
	\pnote{An underlay system utilizes the interference tolerance capability of the primary systems. Hence, by employing techniques such as power control it is able to keep the interference received at the primary system below a certain interference threshold} 
	\pnote{An overlay system requires the involvement of higher layers (for implementing advance coding techniques) to enable the coexistence of primary system and secondary system.}
	\pnote{Finally, the hybrid system that exploits the benefits of interweave and underlay system so as to utlilize the acquired spectrum more efficiently.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[t]{Major Contributions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\pnote{The major contributions are summarized as follows:}
	\pnote{An analytical framework is proposed that follows a stochastic approach to capture the variations induced in the system due to imperfect channel knowledge and allocate time resources for channel estimation}
	\pnote{These variations are captured by means of a stochastic model. Furthermore, a certain amount of time resources are allocated for channel estimation in the secondary user frame structure.} 
	%\pnote{With regard to the psychology established in the previous slide, with no knowledge of the primary user signals,} 
	\pnote{We are faced with the challenge of estimating the channels that exists between two different systems. With this situation in hand, conventional estimation techniques are not applicable. Besides, we have to look for techniques that offer versatility towards unknown primary user signals and low complexity.}
	\pnote{In this regard, a novel estimation technique termed as received-power based estimation is proposed that satisfies the low-complexity and versatility requirements.}
	\pnote{Channel estimation, if not captured appropriately can severly degrade the performance of CR systems}
	\pnote{The variations induced in the system caused uncertainty in the interference. These variations are regulated using the interference constraints} %Secondly, degradation in throughput caused due to the time allocation.} 
	\pnote{Moreover, a system witness a degrdation in the form of throughput. In this regard, performance tradeoff are established that yields the maxumum achievable throughput.}
	%\pnote{In order to regulate uncertainty in interference, new interference constraints are proposed. Secondly, the interplay between the uncertain interference and the secondary throughput is analyzed in terms of performance tradeoffs. These tradeoffs allow us to determine the suitable estimation time that yields the maximum throughput achieved by the CR systems.}
	\pnote{The analytical expressions (derived while establishing the system model) are verified by means of empirical validation.}
	\pnote{Finally, the feasibility of the propositions (time allocation, channel estimation, variations) made are justified by means of a hardware demonstrator}

	%\pnote{Here the deployment scenario corresponding to CSC is transformed into an interweave system}
	\pnote{Interweave system enable coexistence of the primary and secondary system by seperating them in temporal domain} 
	\pnote{Spectrum sensing, a CR technique, is employed at the ST}
	\pnote{By which, the ST detects the presence and absence of primary user signal by listening to the PT. In this way, the ST protects the PR, by not transmitting its own signal whenever the primary user signal is detected.} 
	\pnote{Corresponding to this approach the following signal model is proposed. The signal received at the ST over the channel $\hpo$ depends on the following hypothesis, the PT is active and PT is inactive}
	\pnote{During data transmission, the signal is received at the SR only under two conditions, wherever there is a misdetection or the condition where no false alarm happens.} 
	\pnote{With reference to the signal model, the performance of the interweave system can be jointly characterized in terms of detectors performance, which regulates the interference at the PR and throughput received at SR}
	\pnote{The detector's performance can be characterized in terms of the detection probability and false alarm probability. Considering the fact that no knowledge concerning the PU signal is available, energy detectors is employed.}
	\pnote{Secondary throughput, corresponding to the signal model, the signal received at SR is with and without interference from PT. The prefactor corresponds to the time resources allocated for sensing.}

		\begin{itemize}	
			%\item Lack of channel knowledge renders the performance analysis of CR system incomplete 
			% Through adequate analysis and hardware deployment it is justified that 
			\item Channel knowledge is extremely necessary for the realization of CR techniques %, allowing secondary systems to coexists with the primary system 
			\item An analytical framework is proposed that captures the detrimental effects due to imperfect channel knowledge  
			\item The performed analysis provides answers to specific questions related to imperfect channel knowledge 
				\begin{itemize} 
				\fs{8}{9}
\item How to counter the uncertain interference induced? \item How to evaluate the performance degradation? \item How to determine the suitable estimation time that yields the maximum throughput achieved? \end{itemize}
\item Most importantly, the performed analysis promotes techniques such as 

\begin{itemize} 
\fs{8}{9}
\item implementation of the channel estimation at the secondary system \item energy-based detection and \item received power-based channel estimation \end{itemize} that ultimately encourage hardware feasibility of CR systems
