\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:Int}

Since the invention of smart devices, the mobile traffic has been increasing tremendously over the last decade. According to the recent surveys on mobile traffic by prominent market leaders (Cisco \cite{CISCO14} and Ericsson\cite{Eric15}), the existing mobile traffic is expected to increase $11$-fold  by 2021. The wireless community including the standardization bodies (3GPP \cite{3GPP}) believe that the state-of-the-art standards (fourth-Generation (4G) \index{4G} -- LTE \index{LTE}, WiMAX \index{WiMAX}) are not capable of sustaining these ever-increasing demands in the upcoming decade. With this situation in hand, the standardization bodies are currently in the phase of conceptualizing the requirements of the fifth-Generation (5G) \index{5G} of mobile wireless systems.
Some of these major requirements are: (i) areal capacity in $\SI{}{bits/sec/m^2}$ must increase by a factor of $1000$ compared to 4G, (ii) low latency of approximately \SI{1}{ms}, and (iii) energy- and cost-efficient deployment \cite{Qual13, Andrews14}.
 %One of the major goals is to improve the areal capacity ($\SI{}{bits/s/m^2}$) by a factor of 1000 \cite{Qual13, Andrews14}. \tc{To this end, an extension to the already allocated spectrum is of paramount importance.} 


The feasibility of these requirements can be envisaged through the application of promising approaches such as maximization of the spatial degrees of freedom (using techniques like massive \index{MIMO}MIMO \cite{Lar14} and 3D-beamforming \cite{Hal13}), in-band full duplex communications \index{CR communication!in-band full duplex} \cite{Sab14}, small cell densification \cite{Andrews12, Gel13}, alternatives to the already allocated spectrum -- such as millimeter-Wave technology (mmW) \cite{Rapp13}, visible light communications \cite{Wu14} and Cognitive Radio (CR) communications -- and waveform design \cite{Scha14, Baz15}. A classification of these approaches is described in \figurename~\ref{fig_Int:5G}. In order to narrow down the perspective, in this thesis, a deployment scenario that lays emphasis on the small cell densification and the implementation of CR is proposed. Before proceeding further, it is essential to briefly discuss some of the prerequisites that render small cell densification and CR communication approaches, particularly their combination, a suitable candidate for a 5G network.

\subsubsection*{Small Cell Densification \index{Small cell densification}}

In the recent past, Small Cells (SCs) have emerged as a potential solution for coverage and capacity enhancements inside a wireless network. A SC represents a low power station that ranges from $\SI{10}{m}$ to $\SI{100}{m}$. The reduced transmit distance accomplished with the deployment of SCs enhances the link quality and aids spatial reuse \cite{Chander08}.
%SC is particularly deployed in a indoor or outdoor environments, these include enterprise, shopping complex or residential \cite{SSF14}. 
As a result, small cell densification can leverage the areal capacity of a 5G network \cite{Andrews14}. Because the capacity increases linearly with the number of SCs, it is infeasible to procure the factor of $1000$ in the areal capacity with densification alone. In addition, the operation and the integration of these substantial number of SCs to the backhaul network are cost- and energy-intensive for the mobile operator. Therefore, the degree to which the densification can be achieved by a wireless network is rather limited.





\subsubsection*{Spectrum Extension \index{Spectrum extension}}
Complementing the SCs, an additional spectrum %\footnote{The spectrum corresponds to the radio frequency.} 
is envisioned as a power source that is capable of sustaining the desired areal capacity for 5G. In consideration to the present allocation of the spectrum below $\SI{6}{Hz}$ to different wireless services, it is difficult to procure an extension to the already available spectrum to the mobile communication. Before investigating the potential candidates for the spectrum extension, it is necessary to consider the following classification of the spectrum:
%\begin{itemize}
(i) $> \SI{6}{GHz}$;
(ii) $\le \SI{6}{GHz}$.
%\end{itemize}
This sort of classification allow us to focus on the feasibility characteristics and the issues thereof.


The spectrum beyond \SI{6}{GHz} largely entails the mmW\index{Millimeter-wave technology}, which is well-known for point-to-point communications. Recently, it is envisaged as a powerful source of spectrum for 5G wireless systems. However, the mmW technology is still in its initial stage and along with complex regulatory requirements in this regime, it has to address several challenges like propagation loss, low efficiency of radio frequency components such as power amplifiers, small size of the antenna and link acquisition \cite{Rapp13}. Therefore, in order to capture a deeper insight of its feasibility in 5G, it is essential to overcome the aforementioned challenges in the near future.%\nociteK{Kaushik13, Kaushik14_W, Kaushik14_CC, Kaushik14_P, Kaushik15_CC,Kaushik15_ICC, Kaushik15_D, Kaushik16_TWC, Kaushik16_VTC1, Kaushik16_TCCN, Kaushik16_ICC, Kaushik16_CC, Kaushik16_VTC2, Kaushik17}

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.9\columnwidth]{figures/Grafik_Poster}
\caption{A snapshot of a hardware demonstrator that measures the spectral occupancy in \index{GSM}GSM \SI{1800}{MHz} downlink channels, whereby the black slices represent the spectrum occupancy (1 or 0) corresponding to a single measurement at a given time instant. The bar plots illustrate the spectrum occupancy (u) for each channel with a history of 500 measurements\protect\citeK{Kaushik13}.}
\label{fig_Int:HW_I}
\end{figure}


In contrast to the spectrum beyond \SI{6}{GHz}, an efficient utilization of the spectrum below \SI{6}{GHz} presents an alternative solution. The use of the spectrum in this regime (below \SI{6}{GHz}) is fragmented and statically allocated \cite{Mchen05, Mchen07}, leading to inefficiencies and the shortage in the availability of the spectrum for new services. A glimpse of the measurement campaign demonstrating the underutilized spectrum is presented in \figurename~\ref{fig_Int:HW_I}. The measurements, acquired during the peak hours, illustrate the spectrum occupancy for the GSM \SI{1800}{MHz} downlink sub-channels. The low spectrum occupancy for most of the sub-channels clearly signifies the fact that the demand for the additional spectrum can be fulfilled only by managing the utilization of the available spectrum efficiently. 

In this perspective, CR is foreseen as one of the potential contenders that addresses the spectrum scarcity problem. Since its origin by Mitola \textit{et al.} in 1999 \cite{Mitola99}, this notion has evolved at a significant pace, and consequently has acquired certain maturity. Despite the existence of the theoretical analysis, from a deployment perspective, this technology is still in its preliminary phase \cite{Pawe11}. In order to curtail the gap between the theoretical models and the practical implementations, recently, the wireless community has started to show an inclination\footnote{As indicated by the increased promotion of hardware implementation/demonstration or the events such as spectrum challenge\citeK{Kaushik15_D} in conferences like IEEE DySPAN.} towards models and/or techniques. Hence, facilitating a hardware implementation of this concept in a way encourages the disposition of CR systems in the upcoming 5G wireless systems. Motivated by this fact, this thesis focuses on the performance analysis of CR systems from a deployment perspective. 

In contrast to the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum, Visible Light Communication (VLC) \index{Visible light communication} has started to gain extensive attention for 5G wireless communication, hence, deserves consideration in context to spectrum extension. Despite the fact that VLC offers some attractive characteristics like spatial, spectrum reuse, low energy consumption and security, it has to overcome certain challenges such as mobility and adverse effect of atmospheric conditions while operating outdoor \cite{Wu14}. 


\section{Background and Motivation}
\label{sec:mot}

\subsubsection*{Cognitive Radio Systems \index{Cognitive radio systems!classification}}


In order to proceed further, it is essential to understand the classification of different CR systems described in the literature. An access to the licensed spectrum is an outcome of the paradigm employed by a Secondary User (SU). In this context, all CR systems that provide shared access (used interchangeably with secondary access) to the spectrum mainly fall under the following categories \cite{Goldsmith09}, please consider \figurename~\ref{fig_Int:paradigm} for a graphical illustration of different CR systems and their corresponding techniques considered in the thesis\footnote{A detailed investigation of these techniques is provided in the following chapters.}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item According to Interweave System (IS) \index{Interweave system!definition}, the SUs render an interference-free access to the licensed spectrum by exploiting spectral holes in different domains such as time, frequency, space and polarization. 
\item Underlay System (US) \index{Underlay system!definition} enables an interference-tolerant access, according to which the SUs are allowed to use the licensed spectrum (e.g. Ultra Wide Band (UWB)) as long as they respect the interference constraints of the Primary Receivers (PRs). 
\item Hybrid System (HS) \index{Hybrid system!definition} combines the benefits of the IS (agility to detect spectrum holes in different domains) and the US (interference-tolerant capability) so that the spectrum available for performing secondary access can be used efficiently.  
\item Overlay system \index{Overlay system!definition} considers advanced transmission and coding strategies, which include the participation of higher layers for enabling the spectral coexistence between two or more wireless networks. 
\end{itemize}
The IS, the US and the HS are closely associated with the physical layer, hence, these systems are mostly considered not only for the theoretical analysis but for practical implementations as-well \citeK{Kaushik13, Kaushik14_CC, Kaushik15_D, Kaushik16_CC, Kaushik16_VTC2}, \cite{Cabric04, Cabric06, Kim10}. 
Underlying this fact, this thesis establishes a deployment-centric viewpoint for characterizing the performance of these CR systems. In order to illustrate a successful incorporation of the CR in a 5G network, a specific use-case (deployment scenario) is presented subsequently.

\end{figure}



It is evident from the previous discussion that the spectrum extension via CR systems and SC densification are significant to the \index{5G}5G system. %Recently, ElSawy \textit{et al.} \cite{Elsawy13} have presented Cognitive Small Cell (CSC), a concept that fulfills the capacity demands of the future wireless networks. 
Based on this, a preliminary concept of Cognitive Small Cell (CSC), a promising application that combines the benefits from the SC deployment and the efficient usage of the spectrum below \SI{6}{GHz}, by realizing CR, is presented. A typical scenario where the CSC finds its application would be the co-existence of Wi-Fi or unlicensed small cell and wireless cellular systems \cite{Benn13, Gali15}. The notion of CSC has been previously investigated by Elsawy \textit{et al.} \cite{Elsawy13, Elsawy13_cmag} and Wildemeersch \textit{et al.} \cite{Wild13}, where the authors primarily emphasized on the modelling techniques\footnote{The modelling is based on \index{Stochastic geometry}stochastic geometry, which allows a spatial averaging over multiple network geometries \cite{Haenggi, Haenggi08now}.} that depict the positioning of several CSCs inside the network. Due to this, the performance analysis of the CSC has been limited mainly to network abstraction. In contrast, this thesis examines the fundamental aspects encountered while deploying a CSC, which otherwise could forbid its realization over the hardware. %, which could possibly lead to a successful integration of CSCs in the 5G network. %Consequently, by considering different CR paradigms to enable secondary usage of the licensed spectrum, here a deeper comprehension of the concept is illustrated. %, thereby, making it accessible to 5G systems. 
%To strengthen our understanding of CSC, we demonstrate the feasibility of the respective paradigms by means of hardware implementations.
%Pertaining to the deployment, we analyze the true performance of the CSC as a CR application for the mentioned paradigms.  
 A comprehensive incorporation of CSC in a preliminary 5G architecture is illustrated in \figurename~\ref{fig_Int:archi}. In order to enhance the viability of the proposed network architecture, it is reasonable to highlight some of the essential ingredients pertaining to the deployment of the CSC.

\subsubsection*{Network Elements \index{Cognitive small cell!network elements}}
 In order to propose a successful integration of CSC in a 5G network, the following key elements are essential: a CSC-Base Station (CSC-BS), a Macro Cell-Base Station (MC-BS) and Mobile Stations (MSs), cf. \figurename~\ref{fig_Int:archi}. MSs are the devices either served by the MC-BS over a \textit{direct access} link or the CSC-BS over an \textit{indirect access} link. The direct access and the indirect access are the nomenclature used to distinguish a start-of-the-art (spectrum) access between the MC-BS and the MS from an access between the CSC-BS and the MS representing a CR communication, respectively. Furthermore, the MC-BS is connected to several CSC-BSs over a \textit{wireless backhaul} link. Although the MC-BS and the MS already exist in the conventional cellular architecture, to incorporate the opportunistic access inside the CSC, it is necessary to consider a functionality upgrade.

\subsubsection*{Spectrum Access\index{Cognitive small cell!spectrum access}}
In the proposed network architecture, the access to the spectrum is realized over the wireless backhaul, the direct access and the indirect access links, cf. \figurename~\ref{fig_Int:archi}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A wireless backhaul is a
%quasi-line of sight\footnote{It allows limited number of objects between the direct link.} 
point-to-point wireless link between the CSC-BS and the MC-BS that relays the traffic generated from the CSC to the core network. With regard to the densification of the CSC in 5G network, the wireless backhaul link, in contrast to the optical fiber link, presents a cost-effective and energy-efficient alternative to the mobile operator.
With limited infrastructure required for the deployment, wireless backauling accelerates the installation process and promotes scalability of the network.
For the wireless backhaul link, considering that it is utilized for a longer time duration, an exclusive spectrum represents a viable option. In this context, it is sensible to nominate a mmW band; alternatively, an exclusive band below \SI{6}{GHz} can be acquired using the principles of \index{LSA}Licensed Shared Access (LSA) \cite{ETSI13}.
%These WB links encourage ultra-densification as they brings down the capital expenditure and offer scalability to the vendor. 

\item A direct access link represents a direct access of the MS at the MC-BS over the allocated spectrum. Consequently, the spectrum access for this link is analogous to the one existing in the state-of-the-art wireless standards.
\item The CSC elements (the CSC-BS and the MS) are responsible for executing the secondary access to the licensed spectrum. The additional spectrum, acquired through the realization of CR techniques, \index{CR techniques}including spectrum sensing and power control, at the CSC-BS, is used for the communication between the CSC-BS and the MS over the indirect access link.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Network Compatibility\index{Cognitive small cell!network compatibility}}
Besides secondary access, CSC has to co-exist harmoniously with the other elements existing in the network. In this context, the network elements are embedded with additional functionality such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item The MS procures the control information (signalling and synchronization) over the indirect access link after connecting to the near-by CSC-BS.
\item In order to accomplish a logical placement of CSCs inside the network, the CSC employs S1 and X2 interfaces over the wireless backhaul link.
%Under this situation, the MC-BS, however, remains transparent to the additional spectrum acquired by the CSC over the IA link. 
%For the co-exisitence it is necessary to consider the co-existence of CSCs under the MC. 
\item For situations where several CSC-BSs co-exist under a MC-BS, operations like seamless cross-tier and co-tier mobility constitute a challenging task for the network.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Hardware Feasibility\index{Cognitive small cell!hardware feasibility}}
Along with other ingredients, it is essential to outline certain aspects that pertain to the hardware realizability of the CSC. For the CSC-BS, an antenna mount system consisting of an indoor and an outdoor antenna is proposed. Whereby, the indoor antenna exploits the walls of the building to physically separate the indoor transmissions over the indirect access link. In this way, the CSC is able to mitigate the interference to the primary system and to the neighbouring CSCs, vice-versa. Whereas, the outdoor antenna secures a narrow beam transmission to enhance the link quality for the wireless backhaul link. Besides this, it is a well-known fact that Software Defined Radio \index{SDR}(SDR) has played an important role in the genesis of the CR \cite{Jondral05}. Which means that the SDR can serve as a suitable platform for executing CR techniques, accomplishing rapid prototyping for the CR systems. Taking this into account, the SDR platform is utilized for realizing (or demonstrating) the CR functionality pursued by the CSC-BS over a hardware.


\subsubsection*{Indoor Deployment\index{Cognitive small cell!indoor deployment}}
From a market survey, it has been depicted that $70\%$ of the mobile traffic is originated from indoor locations \cite{Chander08}. Another survey of the leading \index{WiMAX}WiMAX operators revealed that $80\%$ of their subscribers will be connected indoors \cite{Pao07}. In addition, a new range of wireless services, categorized as Internet of Things (IoT), will operate indoors. Following these facts, it is clear that the performance gains in terms of spectrum reuse will be far more consequential if we manage to consolidate these sources of traffic by means of SCs deployment. In order to capture the indoor originated traffic, it is sensible to consider the residential and enterprise as the main deployment scenarios for the CSC, cf. \figurename~\ref{fig_Int:archi}. Except for a different coverage regime, the operating principles of these scenarios are analogous. Besides, in context with the CR, where the interference mitigation between the primary and the secondary systems is a significant aspect, a CR communication within walls (which attributes to an indoor deployment) provides a spatial separation between the two systems. This, however, does not indicate that CR communication is limited to indoor scenarios. As the matter of fact, the indoor deployment is opted \begin{itemize} \item to exploit the behavioral dimension of the traffic source (traffic management) and \item to mitigate the interference between the two systems \end{itemize} so that co-existence with the licensed users is encouraged. 
In this regard, an indoor scenario is considered for the deployment of the CSC, cf. \figurename~\ref{fig_Int:archi}. Despite the interference mitigation, an effective control over the interference is essential for a successful operation of the CR systems. Therefore, the next section extensively discusses the performance of the CR systems. 

\subsection{Performance Analysis\index{Cognitive radio systems!performance analysis}}
Since the evolution of wireless systems, understanding the performance of novel algorithms/techniques related to the wireless systems has always been a challenging task. With regard to this, for a CR system, because of the involvement of two different systems, namely primary and secondary systems, this task is even more difficult. On one end, it has been engaging a large number of researchers that are eager to find solutions for the new set of problems that are emerging from an interplay between these two systems, leading them to develop theoretical models (system models). As a result, these models allow us to determine the performance limits of the CR system. However, to sustain analytical tractability, they tend to consider assumptions that in most situations are unrealistic for a hardware deployment.  %However, with the lack of concrete guidelines, different perspective have forward for the performance analysis.
 On the other end, due to the co-existence of the two systems sharing the same spectrum, the performance of a CR system is critical to the regulatory bodies and the mobile operators\footnote{These operators are the ones who are willing to share their license (as primary system) or the ones who are willing to access the licensed spectrum (as secondary system).}, responsible for managing the spectrum. In this regard, despite the numerous theoretical models that exist in the literature, when it comes to judging the performance of a CR system, the regulatory bodies give more preference to the hardware implementations. 

These different mindsets and the lack of proper guidelines ultimately slow down the evolution of the CR in realistic scenarios. Under this situation, it is advisable to merge these mindsets and establish a deployment-centric viewpoint towards the CR systems, according to which the upcoming models and/or techniques not only associate themselves to the performance characterization but are eligible for practical implementations as-well. This viewpoint, also the main motivation behind this work, is emphasized throughout the thesis. 

The co-existence between the primary and the secondary systems can be accomplished only through a detailed analysis of the performance of these systems. %The lack of proper guidelines defining these systems and their co-existence leave the performance analysis of the CR systems a challenging task. 
To address this issue, the researchers have made an intensive effort to develop system models \cite{Liang08, Kang209, Kang09}\footnote{For the sake of brevity, only limited works from the literature representing the performance analysis have been cited in this chapter. The following chapters corresponding to different CR systems consider an in-depth analysis of the related work.} that characterize the performance of the CR systems. The performed analysis boils down to the fact that the CR systems are allowed to successfully co-exist with the primary system only if they respect the interference power (or interference) at the primary system caused due to an access to the licensed spectrum. In other words, imposing an interference constraint ensures a sufficient protection to the primary systems and enables the CR system to perform secondary access.
 

With regard to this constraint, the CR system also intends to deliver a certain Quality of Service/Quality of Experience (QoS/QoE) in the form of throughput to their corresponding Secondary Receiver (SR), defined as \index{Secondary throughput}\textit{Secondary throughput}. Such a QoS/QoE provisioning helps us to determine the potential applications or prominent use-cases for the CR system. For instance, the secondary throughput's knowledge over the access link enables the CR to execute a band allocation policy, based on which the CR can relinquish those channels that ineffectively contribute to the secondary throughput, and/or are responsible for causing interference at the primary system. As a result, the performance of a CR system can be jointly characterized in terms of the harmful interference received at the primary system and the throughput achieved by the secondary system. 
%Because of such intricacies that are inherent to a CR system, its performance analysis have always been an interesting challenge. 
But the fact is, the derived expressions depicting the performance of the CR systems are rarely examined over the hardware. Mainly, because of the complicated deployment scenario or the computational complexity of the employed CR techniques, leaving the validity of the existing theoretical analysis questionable. Taking this issue into account, this thesis analyzes the performance of the CR systems while putting emphasis on the fact that the performed analysis can be easily validated through a hardware implementation. 

\subsection{Imperfect Channel Knowledge for CR systems\index{Cognitive radio systems!imperfect channel knowledge}}

In a nutshell, \textit{a CR is an agile system that possesses the ability to adapt to the changes in the environment}. From a physical layer perspective, this corresponds to the response to the changes incurred within the system or from the outside environment, which in a way leads to a performance enhancement. Inherent to the wireless systems, these changes may arise due to the variations in the signal caused by the presence of the thermal noise at the receiver and the fading in the channel. It is well-known from the text-books, related to wireless communications \cite{simon2005, Goldsmith05, Tse05}, that the channel fading, in particular, is critical for wireless systems. As a matter of fact, channel knowledge -- in the form of Channel State Information at the Transmitter \index{CSIT}(CSIT) available through a feedback from the receivers -- has rendered a substantial improvement in the performance in terms of data rate, for instance, multiplexing gains for a \index{MIMO}MIMO system \cite{Ali12}. 


\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = \figscalet]{figures/CR_Scenario_Hybrid}
\caption{A cognitive small cell scenario demonstrating: (i) the CR systems employed at the CSC-BS, (ii) the associated network elements, which constitute Cognitive Small Cell-Base Station/Secondary Transmitter (CSC-BS/ST), Mobile Station/Secondary Receiver (MS/SR), Macro Cell-Base Station (MC-BS) and Primary Transmitter (PT), (iii) the interacting channels: sensing ($\hpo$), interference ($\hptw, \hpth$) and access ($\hs$) channels.}
\label{fig_Int:scenario}
%\vspace{-6mm}
\end{figure}


In context with a CR system, the channel knowledge, unlike the conventional or state-of-the-art wireless systems, is not confined to a single transmitter-receiver link, rather it includes all the related channels that exist within as-well-as across the primary and the secondary systems, cf. \figurename~\ref{fig_Int:scenario}. At this stage, it is worth understanding the fact that channel knowledge is paramount for the hardware implementation of the CR systems, since it allows them to exercise different CR techniques, cf. \figurename~\ref{fig_Int:paradigm}, and to respect the desired constraints, which are necessary for their co-existence with the primary systems. Besides, from a theoretical perspective, the channel knowledge is required for the performance characterization. Absence of this knowledge, especially of those channels that are related to the interference at the primary systems, renders the performance characterization of a CR system inadequate for the practical implementations. 

Despite the existence of multitude of analytical models in the literature (ISs -- \cite{Liang08, Sharma14, Pradhan15}, USs -- \cite{Xing07, Ghasemi07, Kang09}, HSs -- \cite{Song13, Gmira15, Jiang13, Fili15}) that consider with the performance analysis of a CR system, its performance with regard to the channel estimation, due to the complexity of the underlying problem, has never been completely understood\footnote{In context to the US, certain works \cite{Musa09, Suraweera10, Kim12} have dealt with the issue of channel estimation in a CR system, however, unlike this thesis, the investigation has not been exhaustive. This augmented is extensively supported in Chapter \ref{chap:US} under the section ``Related Work''.}. In order to curtail this gap, this thesis capitalizes on the estimation of the involved channels in a CR system. In this sense, the accessibility of the channel knowledge at the CSC-BS facilitates the implementation of the CR techniques at the CSC-BS, establishing a CR communication link with the MS over the acquired spectrum. More importantly, this knowledge allows us to regulate the interference at the PR below a desired level. 

Certainly, an access to the channel knowledge comes at a certain cost. Firstly, the inclusion of channel estimation demands an allocation of a certain time interval by the CSC-BS. In consideration to the time allocation, a certain degradation in the performance in terms of the throughput is obvious. Secondly, the variations introduced due to the estimation process, also treated as imperfect channel knowledge, lead to an uncertainty in the interference, defined as \index{Uncertain interference}\textit{uncertain interference}\footnote{The uncertain here specifically symbolizes the variations in the interference power received at the PR that exists because of the imperfect channel knowledge.}, to the primary systems. If not considered, this uncertain interference may severely degrade the performance of the CR systems. In order to approach a successful integration of channel estimation into the CR system, it is essential to consider the performance degradation arising due to the time allocation and the uncertain interference in the system model. These effects concerning the performance degradation have been completely left aside in the existing models that consider the perfect channel knowledge. This thesis takes these effects into account to establish analytical frameworks (each for the IS, the US and the HS) that allow us to understand the behaviour of the CR systems under those situations that are close to realistic scenarios. %Subsequently, these frameworks are utilized to characterize the performance of the respective CR systems. 

Shifting the focus back to the deployment, it is worthy to understand that the channel estimation, facilitating shared access to the licensed spectrum, is viable only if the CR system is equipped with the knowledge about to the primary system. %In this way, the CR system is dependent on the wireless standard followed by the primary system. 
This implies that in order to perform channel estimation based on conventional techniques -- such as training-based \cite{Stoica03}, pilot-based \cite{Gifford05, Gifford08}, signal to noise ratio-based \cite{Chav11, Sharma13} channel estimation, which already exist in the literature -- a preliminary processing in the form of synchronization and demodulation of the baseband signal received from the primary system is necessary. The existence of multiple wireless standards and their complexity preclude us from deploying a dedicated circuitry corresponding to each primary system \cite{Ghasemi08_cm}. The fact is, these conventional channel estimation techniques are well-known for delivering accurate channel estimates, that is why employed in state-of-the-art wireless standards. However, in context with the CR systems, these techniques \begin{itemize} \item increase the complexity related to the channel estimation, evaluated in terms of the mathematical operations, and (or) \item demand the demodulation of the Primary User (PU) signal. \end{itemize} 

Under these circumstances, it is advisable to consider only those solutions that offer low complexity and show versatility towards different PU signals. Generally speaking, such solutions will not only ease the deployment process but also have a large acceptance among the CR community. For instance, energy-based detection (or energy detection) has been a popular choice compared to its counterparts such as matched filtering-based and cyclostationary-based detection for detecting a PU signal, required for performing spectrum sensing for the interweave systems (discussed later in Chapter \ref{chap:IS}). A direct comparison of these techniques by simply counting their implementations for hardware demonstration has been done in \cite{Pawe11}. 

On similar grounds as energy detection, in order to approach the channel estimation for the CR system, particularly for the channels that involve the primary systems, a \textit{received power-based}\index{Channel estimation!received power-based}\footnote{It is worthy to understand that the received power refers to the signal power measured after analog to digital conversion, hence, it consists of the signal and the noise power. Traditionally, received signal strength is a metric used for measuring signal quality to perform tasks such as cell association and handover \cite{Boga16}.} channel estimation technique is proposed as a part of the analytical framework. This channel estimation technique is introduced to substitute the conventional techniques because, like energy detection, employing received power-based estimation assures the low complexity and the versatility towards unknown PU signal requirements of the CR system, and consequently facilitates its deployment. Besides, the channel within the secondary framework, treated as a conventional transmitter-receiver link, does not fall in the aforementioned category. Therefore, its knowledge is procured by employing a pilot-based channel estimation technique\index{Channel estimation!pilot-based}.

\section{Main Contributions}
At this stage, it is well-understood that the knowledge of the related channels is crucial for the application of CR techniques in the practical scenarios. In order to facilitate the hardware deployment of a CSC, a CR application, this thesis capitalizes on the successful integration of this knowledge for different CR systems, namely interweave, underlay and hybrid systems. In this context, the main contributions and the observations of this thesis (highlighted in \figurename~\ref{fig_Int:contri}) are summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Analytical Framework}: 
As a major contribution, this thesis proposes an analytical framework, corresponding to the different CR systems (which are followed in Chapter \ref{chap:IS}, Chapter \ref{chap:US} and Chapter \ref{chap:HS}, respectively) that incorporates the estimation of the involved channels between the primary and the secondary systems, a crucial aspect that has been addressed inadequately in the literature. \begin{mdframed}[style=MyFrame] \textit{Low-complex and versatile channel estimation technique} - In order to satisfy the low complexity and the versatility towards unknown PU signal requirements, which are necessary for the deployment of the CR systems, a received power-based channel estimation is included in the proposed framework. In this regard, an effort has been made to facilitate a direct incorporation of the estimated parameter (received power) to the performance characterization of the CR systems. \end{mdframed} \begin{mdframed}[style=MyFrame] \textit{Impact of Incorporating Channel Estimation} - In addition, a careful allocation of the time interval (referred as estimation time), for the purpose of performing channel estimation, in the medium access of the secondary system is proposed. Apart from this, this thesis considers a stochastic approach to tackle the variations in the CR system that arise due to the imperfect channel knowledge (estimation error). In contrast to the existing models that preclude channel estimation (or consider perfect channel knowledge), thereby overestimating the performance of the CR systems, this thesis captures a clear insight on the influence of the time allocation and the imperfect channel knowledge on performance of the CR system. Obviously, the imperfect channel knowledge and the time allocation have a detrimental effect on the performance of the CR system, thus leading to a \textit{performance degradation}. This degradation is qualified through a comparison between the existing models and the estimation model (the one included as a part of the proposed framework). Particularly, the variations lead to uncertain interference, which in certain situations is deleterious to the primary system. This uncertainty in the interference is captured by means of novel constraints, introduced as a part of this framework. \end{mdframed} In order to closely examine the relationship between the system parameters, theoretical expressions pertaining to the performance analysis of the CR system are derived. Furthermore, to understand the performance of the proposed framework in fading scenarios, especially for the interweave and the underlay systems, the analysis is extended to obtain the theoretical expressions that incur the effect of fading in the involved channels. Finally, to exclude any discrepancy in the analysis, the obtained expressions are verified by means of Monte-Carlo simulations. 
\item \textit{Performance Tradeoffs \index{Cognitive radio systems!performance tradeoffs|see{Tradeoffs}}}: 
As a major observation, it has been identified that the estimation time is closely associated with the performance of the CR systems. On one side, it is related to the variations incurred in the system, through which the level of uncertainty in the interference can be effectively controlled, ultimately affecting the performance in terms of the secondary throughput. While on the other side, the time allocation directly influences the secondary throughput. In this thesis, this kind of dual dependency of the secondary throughput on the estimation time has been investigated in the form of performance tradeoffs, namely \textit{estimation-sensing-throughput} tradeoff for the IS and the HS, and \textit{estimation-throughput} tradeoff for the US. \begin{mdframed}[style=MyFrame] \textit{Suitable estimation and sensing durations} - These tradeoffs present a useful tool for visualizing the response of a CR system to different choices of the estimation time so that the performance degradation introduced due to the channel estimation can be precisely regulated. In other words, a system designer can utilize these tradeoffs to preclude situations under which the performance degradation becomes intolerable. Conversely, from a theoretical perspective, these tradeoffs can be used to determine a suitable estimation time that yields the maximum achievable secondary throughput while obeying the interference constraints. \end{mdframed}
 
 
\item \textit{Hardware deployment}: 
In contrast to the theoretical analysis, this thesis lays emphasis on the portability of the analytical framework on a hardware platform. To a great extent, this not only validates the accuracy of the assumptions made while deriving the theoretical expressions but also justifies the applicability of the proposed framework in realistic scenarios. \begin{mdframed}[style=MyFrame] \textit{Empirical Validation} - With the implementation of the received power-based estimation technique, this thesis adds further justification to the claims such as the low complexity and the versatility to unknown PU signals, presented while developing the analytical framework. Considering these facts, a software defined radio platform is deployed for obtaining the measurements, required for the validation process. In order to complement the validation, the theoretical expressions, which include the probability density functions (characterizing the variations in the estimated parameters) and the performance tradeoff, are compared with their empirical counterparts. \end{mdframed} \begin{mdframed}[style=MyFrame] \textit{Hardware Demonstration} - Besides validation, this thesis presents a demonstrator that certifies the necessity of channels' knowledge for the performance characterization as-well-as for the operation of a CR system over the hardware. In this regard, following the guidelines of an US a demonstrator is deployed. \end{mdframed} As a part of the deployment process, % to determine the performance of a CR system. As a major outcome of the deployment process, the significance of the channels' knowledge for the performance characterization as-well-as for the deployment, in context with the CR, is justified. %
in order to illustrate a successful deployment of the CR systems, this thesis identifies some key issues, that are usually left aside while performing the theoretical analysis, and proposes the corresponding simplifications/solutions.

\section{Organization} %\todo{Reconsider while revising the individual chapters. Also, update the hyper-links to the Sections below.}

The rest of the chapters in this thesis are organized as follows:

Chapter \ref{chap:IS} develops an analytical framework that incorporates the estimation of the involved channels in accordance with the interweave scenario. In this context, the indoor deployment scenario is transformed into an interweave scenario, whereby a spectrum sensing mechanism is employed at the CSC-BS enabling a secondary access to the licensed spectrum. Section \ref{sec_IS:ana} derives the theoretical expressions to capture the effect of imperfect channel knowledge on the performance of an IS. Further, Section \ref{sec_IS:num_ana} establishes an estimation-sensing-throughput tradeoff that depicts the suitable estimation and the suitable sensing time intervals at which the maximum secondary throughput is achieved by an IS. 


Following a similar methodology as Chapter \ref{chap:IS}, Chapter \ref{chap:US} develops an analytical framework that incorporates the estimation of the involved channels in accordance to the underlay scenario. To implement the underlay technique within the CSC, the deployment scenario is modified such that a power control mechanism is employed at the CSC-BS so that interference remains within the desired tolerance limits at the PR. As a part of the proposed framework, Section \ref{sec_US:th_ana} derives the theoretical expressions for the power control and the secondary throughput, capturing the effect of imperfect channel knowledge and characterizing the performance of an US. In the end, the performance is jointly characterized in terms of estimation-throughput tradeoff that determines the achievable secondary throughput for an US.  

Although the interweave and the underlay system, discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:IS} and Chapter \ref{chap:US}, propose effective ways of performing secondary access, these systems do not represent the best techniques of utilizing the licensed spectrum efficiently. In this regard, to promote the efficient usage of the licensed spectrum by the secondary users, the underlay and the interweave techniques are combined to realize a hybrid scenario. Motivated by this fact, Chapter \ref{chap:HS} develops an analytical framework that incorporates the estimation of involved channels with respect to the hybrid scenario. In this context, the indoor scenario is modified such that the CSC-BS employs spectrum sensing as-well-as power control mechanism to perform secondary access. The theoretical expressions derived in this chapter incorporate the effect of imperfect channel knowledge, depicting the performance of the HS. Analog to Chapter \ref{chap:IS}, an estimation-sensing-throughput tradeoff that yields the achievable secondary throughput for an HS is characterized in this chapter. 

 
In order to reveal the ground truth regarding the analysis proposed in previous chapters, Chapter \ref{chap:HVD} identifies some of the essential aspects that facilitate the deployment of the proposed framework. In this regard, a hardware is deployed that implements the channel estimation, realizes the interference constraints, validates the performance analysis and demonstrates the principle working of the US.   

Finally, Chapter \ref{chap:Con} summarizes the thesis and presents some extensions of performed analysis for future investigations.
