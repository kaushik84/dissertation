\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

My time at Communications Engineering Lab (CEL) has been a wonderful journey. This would not have happened without the support of some important people. First and foremost, I would like to sincerely thank my advisor Prof. Dr.\,rer.\,nat. Friedrich K. Jondral for showing his belief and agreeing to supervise me. %Despite my lack of proficiency to the German language, he  
I will always admire him for his patience, guidance and for providing me a suitable environment to carry out research. Next, I would like to thank Prof. Dr.\,-Ing. Anja Klein from University of Darmstadt for agreeing to co-supervise my thesis.

I would like to thank my colleagues at CEL, specially Dr.\,-Ing. Holger J\"akel, Dr.\,-Ing. Ralph Tanbourgi, Dr.\,-Ing. Noha El Gemayel and Dipl.\,-Ing Johannes Fink, who have been extremely supportive and always remained open for discussions. I would also like to thank Frau Beate Mast and Frau Single for handling the administration, Frau Angelika Olbrich for helping me out with graphics, and Herr Reiner Linnenkohl and Herr Peter Herttrich for handling the IT. During this time period, I had an opportunity to supervise students. I must agree to the fact that students are the best teachers. I am extremely thankful for their contribution. 

Outside CEL, I had an opportunity to collaborate with Dr. Shree Krishna Sharma and Dr. Symeon Chatzinotas and Prof. Bj\"orn Ottersten from University of Luxembourg. I would like to them for their insightful suggestions that have been beneficial for my research.

Lastly, I am indebted to my parents Poonam and Rajesh, its their hardwork and sacrifices that have brought me this far. In particular, I would like to thank my wife Mini for her intense love, her constant support during the stressful periods and for giving me the most beautiful gift of my life, my daughter Alaiza.
