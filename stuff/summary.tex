Over the last decade, wireless communication is witnessing a tremendous growth in the mobile traffic due to ever-increasing number of connected devices. Certainly, the state-of-the-art standards are incapable of accommodating the huge demand of mobile data, originating from these devices. A substantial portion of this demand can be satisfied through an additional spectrum. Due to exclusive usage, the spectrum below $\SI{6}{GHz}$ -- suitable for mobile communications -- is incapable to meet up the demand of the additional spectrum, leading to its scarcity. To this end, cognitive radio, along with millimeter technology and visible-light communication, is envisaged as the powerful source of spectrum. A cognitive radio aims at an efficient utilization of the spectrum below $\SI{6}{GHz}$ by enabling a secondary access to the licensed spectrum while guaranteeing sufficient protection to the licensed users. In this regard, the performance analysis has been critical to a cognitive radio system that, in-turn, encourages its hardware deployment. 


Despite an extensive amount of literature dedicated to topic of cognitive radio communication, its performance analysis has been rarely looked from a deployment perspective. Motivated by this fact, this thesis establishes a deployment-centric viewpoint while analyzing the performance of a cognitive radio system. In this context,
