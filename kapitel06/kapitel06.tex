\chapter{Hardware Implementation}
\label{chap:Field}

Previous chapters (chapter \ref{chap:IS}, chapter \ref{chap:US} and chapter \ref{chap:HS}) focussed on characterizing the performance of different CR systems jointly in terms of interference power received by the primary receiver and throughput at the secondary receiver by taking the estimation of the involved channels into account. In addition, it has been motivated that the low complexity and the versatility towards unknown primary user signals requirements can be satisfied by employing unconventional channel estimation techniques such as received power-based estimation for acquiring the knowledge of the interacting channels, particularly the channels between the primary and the secondary systems. However, the aforementioned analysis in the previous chapters has been limited to the theoretical expressions. Besides characterizing the performance of a CR system based on analytical expressions, it is equally challenging to depict its hardware realizability. This chapter presents a hardware demonstrating the feasibility of the CSC-BS as a CR system. As a result, it complements the performance analysis by deploying the proposed channel estimation techniques on a hardware. By doing this, the applicability of the assumptions considered while deriving the analytical expressions can be examined. These investigations are essential to facilitate the evolution of the proposed analytical framework. Without any specific argumentation, an underlay system is considered for the deployment.    
%\begin{abstract}        % give a summary of your paper
%Cognitive radio is one of the potential contenders that address the problem of spectrum scarcity by making efficient use of the currently allocated spectrum below \SI{6}{GHz}. A secondary access to the licensed spectrum is only possible, if the cognitive radio systems restrict the interference to the primary systems. However, the performance analysis of such a cognitive radio system is a challenging task. Currently, performance evaluation of underlay systems is limited to theoretical analysis. Most of the existing theoretical investigations make certain assumptions in order to sustain analytical tractability, which could be unrealistic from the deployment perspective. Motivated by this fact, in this work, we validate the performance of an underlay system by means of laboratory measurements, and consequently propose a hardware demonstrator of such a system. Moreover, we present a graphical user interface to provide insights to the working of the proposed demonstrator and highlight the main issues faced during this experimental study.

%\section{Related Work}

%The amount of data transmitted over wireless channels is constantly increasing. However, the available spectrum is scarce and expensive, with more and more operators competing for their share of it. Therefore, ways have to be found to use the available spectrum more efficiently. Cognitive radio networks do so by enabling dynamic spectrum access to multiple systems. Secondary access to the licensed spectrum has been extensively investigated in the literature and is mainly categorized in terms of three cognitive radio paradigms \cite{Goldsmith09}: 
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item An interweave system exploits time gaps in the spectrum of primary users for data transmission. 
%	\item An overlay system involves higher network layers to employ advanced coding algorithms to transmit data simultaneously with other systems. 
%	\item In an underlay system, spectrum access is enabled only if the interference power received at primary users is below a certain amount. This can be achieved, for instance, by employing a power control mechanism at the secondary transmitter. 
%\end{enumerate}

%The existing investigations in \cite{Ghasemi07, Xin09, Musa09} depicted the performance limits in terms of throughput achieved at the secondary receiver for the underlay system. However, the performance evaluation has been limited to theoretical analysis, which tends to make certain assumptions (for instance, perfect knowledge of channel), that are not applicable in hardware implementations \cite{Sharma15}. Recently, hardware implementations in context to cognitive radio systems have started to receive significant attention \cite{Ngu13, Anas12, Combes15}, however these deployments are mainly concerned with the interweave system. In this regard, we provide insights for the deployment of underlay systems, in this paper. More specifically, we extend the mathematical framework derived in \cite{Kaushik15} to validate the performance of underlay systems by means of experimental analysis. To complement the analysis presented in \cite{Kaushik15}, 

This chapter provides the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Empirical validation: The performance of the underlay systems subject to the employment of received power-based between the PR and the ST is validated by means of a hardware deployment. The variations (induced due to incorporation of channel estimation) in the system parameters are validated by comparing their probability density functions obtained from the measurements to the one computed analytically. Moreover, the joint performance of the underlay system is validated in terms of estimation-throughput tradeoff proposed in chapter \ref{chap:US}. %A suitable hardware environment is establish to perform measurements and evaluate their results by comparing them with the theoretical expressions.
	\item Demonstrator: Upon validating the theoretical expressions, a hardware demonstrator following the guidelines of an underlay system is deployed. In this context, the applicability of the proposed framework in realistic scenarios can be justified. A graphical user interference is designed to procure insights to the working of the demonstrator.	
\end{itemize}

%This paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sysmod} introduces the system model. Section \ref{val} describes the experimental setup and the validation of the mathematical model. Section \ref{demo} portrays the implementation of the underlay system's hardware demonstrator. Finally, Section \ref{con} concludes the paper.


\section{System Model}
\label{sysmod}

\subsection{Simplifications}
\label{ssec:simp1}
In contrast to the framework presented in chapter \ref{chap:US}, the following simplifications and modifications are considered for the hardware implementation.
\begin{itemize}
\item The channel estimation (received power-based) is only deployed for the link between the PR and the ST, which is associated with the interference (power) received at the PR. In order to simplify the deployment, the interference from the PTs at the SR is neglected\footnote{Although the interference from the PTs plays an significant role in characterizing the throughput at the SR, the interference at the PR is more critical for the PU or regulatory bodies.}. In addition, perfect knowledge of the access channel between the ST and the SR that employs the pilot-based channel estimation is considered\footnote{Since the effect due to the pilot-based channel estimation in terms of time allocated within the frame structure and the amount of variations induced has negligible effect on the performance degradation of the CR system, perfect channel estimation for access channel is a valid argument.}.  
\item The measurements for the validation and the demonstrator consider the deterministic behaviour of the interference channel.  
\item In contrast to the outage constraint proposed in chapter \ref{chap:US}, a confidence probability constraint is employed for capturing the variations due to channel estimation around the interference temperature. %Moreover, previous analysis considers the realization of the power control over multiple frame. Here, the power control subject  
\item Lastly, in contrast to the OFDM signal considered in chapter \ref{chap:US}, in this chapter all transmit signals (which include pilot and data signals) at the primary and the secondary systems are modeled as a PSK signal. 
\end{itemize}

In accordance to these simplifications and the modifications, the system model for the underlay system depicted in chapter \ref{chap:US} is slightly modified. 

\subsection{Underlay Scenario and Medium Access}
\label{scenario}

	\label{szenarioA}
	%\vspace{-10 pt}
\end{figure}



\figurename~\ref{szenarioA} depicts a small cell deployment consisting of a CSC-BS, a MS, a PR and a MC-BS. Analog to the previous scenarios, the CSC-BS and the MS represent a ST and a SR. The channels between the PR and the ST and between the ST and SR are designated as interference and access channels with channel gains $\gpo$ and $\gs$, respectively. A power control mechanism is employed at the ST to ensure that interference received at the PR is below a certain level. In order to exercise power control mechanism, it is necessary to acquire the knowledge of the channel between the ST and the PR. As proposed in chapter \ref{chap:US}, the ST can retrieve this information by listening to a pilot or beacon signal transmitted by the PR. %For the received pilot signal ($y_\textrm{rcvd}$) and its power, we use the model and notations from \cite{Kaushik15}.


A slotted medium access is implemented at the ST with a frame duration of $T$. The knowledge of the interference channel is acquired by employing channel reciprocity over the link PR-ST. $T$ is selected such that the channel can be assumed to remain constant for the frame duration. %Based on this premise, $g_\textrm{p}$ and $g_\textrm{s}$ are constant within one frame and included in $\alpha_\textrm{p}$ and $\alpha_\textrm{s}$ for further analysis.
In order to implement a power control mechanism, the frame interval is divided in two phases, refer to\figurename~\ref{szenarioA}. During the estimation phase of duration $\test$ (estimation time), the ST measures the received power of the pilot signal transmitted by the PR. Based on this received power, the ST estimates $\ehpo$ and control its transmit power for the secondary link in order to satisfy the interference constraint at the PR. During the data transmission phase $T-\test$, the ST transmits data with the controlled power to the SR.

\subsection{Signal Model}
The discrete and complex signal received at the ST is given by
%ived signal at the ST, transmitted by the PR cf. \figurename~\ref{fig:scenario}, is sampled with a sampling frequency of $\fsam$ and is given by
\begin{equation}
\yrcvd[n] = \gpo \cdot \xtranpr[n] + \nas[n],
\label{eq:sys_mod_st}
\end{equation}
where $\xtranpr[n]$ corresponds to a discrete constant power signal transmitted by the PR, $\pgpo$ represents the power gain for the channel PR-ST and $\nas[n]$ is circularly symmetric Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) at the ST.
 $\ptranpr$  corresponds to the transmit power at the PR and $\nas[n]$ is an independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian random process with mean $\e{}{\nas[n]} = 0$ and variance $\e{}{|\nas[n]|^2} = \nps$. By the listening to the transitions fro the PR, the estimated received power at the ST, computed using $\test \fsam (= N)$ samples, is given as
\begin{align}
\eprcvd = \s{\test \fsam}{ |\gpo \xtranpr[n] + \nas|^2},
\label{eq:prcvd} 
\end{align}
where $\fsam$ denotes the sampling frequency. After implementing the power control $(\preg)$ at the ST during the data transmission, the received signal at the PR is given by
\begin{equation}
\yp[n] = \gpo \cdot \xscont[n] + \nap[n],
\label{eq:sys_mod_pr}
\end{equation}
and on the other side, the received signal at the SR follows
\begin{equation}
\ys[n] = \gs \cdot \xscont[n] + \nas[n],
\label{eq:sys_mod_sr}
\end{equation}
where $\xscont[n]$ is an i.i.d. random process. The controlled power at the ST is determined as 
\begin{align}
\epreg = \s{(T - \test) \fsam}{|\xscont[n]|^2} 
\label{eq:preg} 
\end{align}
Further, $\pgpo$ and $\pgs$ represent the power gains for channel ST-PR and ST-SR, cf. \figurename~\ref{szenarioA}.
The received powers at the PR and the SR are evaluated as 
\begin{align}
\eprcvdpr = \s{(T - \test) \fsam}{|\yp[n]^2|}  \intertext{ and} \prcvdsr\footnote{In the simplication, it is assumed that the access channel is perfectly known.} = \s{(T - \test) \fsam}{|\ys[n]^2|}, 
\end{align}
respectively. Likewise (\ref{eq:sys_mod_st}), $\nap[n]$ and $\nas[n]$ represents circularly symmetric AWGN at PR and ST with zero mean and variance $\e{}{|\nap[n]|^2} = \npp$ and $\e{}{|\nas[n]|^2} = \nps$, correspondingly. %Consider that $\ptran$, $\preg$ and $\pp$ correspond to power for a given frame. 
%For (\ref{eq:sys_mod_sr}), we assume that the interference at SR from the PR via beacon or pilot channel is $< \nps$, which is a valid assumption considering the indoor scenario depicted in \figurename~\ref{fig:scenario}. 
%For (\ref{eq:sys_mod_sr}), we consider a perfect allignment of the ST to the beacon or pilot channe
%\subsubsection{Channel}

After utilizing $\test$ for channel estimation, the throughput at the SR (secondary throughput) over the access channel is given by
\begin{equation}
\ers = \frac{T - \test}{T} \log_2 \left(1 + \frac{\gs \epreg }{\nps} \right). 
\label{eq:sthr}
\end{equation}


All transmitted signals are subjected to distance dependent path loss and small scale fading gains depicted as $\gpo, \gs$. In the analysis, the coherence time of the channels $\approx T$ is considered. But, there will be scenarios where the coherence time exceeds $T$, in such cases the expressions derived in this chapter depicts a lower performance bound.


\section{Theoretical Analysis}
\label{model}
In order establish a close relationship between the analytical framework and the hardware implementation, the sequence of events depicted by the underlay scenario in \figurename~\ref{szenarioA} are summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	%\item The PR sends a pilot signal with power $\ptranpr$ to the ST.
	\item The ST estimates the power received $\eprcvd$ (receiver power-based estimation) by listening to the pilot signal received from the PR over the interference channel. In the context of the hardware implementation, an unmodulated sinusoidal signal is sent as a pilot or beacon signal\footnote{The sinusoidal signal is mathematically equivalent to the constant power signal sent by the PR, which resembles a constant phase modulated signal or a perfectly downsampled (by choosing the sampling point appropriately thereby satisfying the Niquist criterion) PSK signal.}.
	\item With the knowledge of the $\ptranpr$ and the estimate $\eprcvd$, the ST indirectly acquires the knowledge of $\epgpo$. 
	Upon acquiring this knowledge, a power control is employed at the ST. Using $\eprcvd$, $\epreg$ is determined as 
\begin{align}
\epreg = \frac{\ite K}{\eprcvd}, \label{eq:preg} 
\end{align}
where $K$ represents a scaling factor. The scaling factor is required at the ST to hold $\e{}{\eprcvdpr}$ at $\ite$. It is defined as
\begin{align}
K = \frac{1}{ \e{\eprcvd}{\frac{\gpo}{\eprcvd}}},% = \fr
\end{align}
where, $\e{\eprcvd}{\cdot}$ represents the expectation over $\eprcvd$.
	%It is scaled such that, in case of perfect channel reciprocity and the absence of noise on the primary link, the interference power arriving at the PR ($\prcvdpr$) has the value of the interference temperature ($\ite$). %In control theory terms, $\ite$ is the setpoint for $\prcvdpr$.
	\item The ST transmits data to the SR with $\preg$. 
	%\item The SR receives the data signal with power $\preg$ It provides this value back over a feedback channel to the ST, where it is used to estimate the expected secondary throughput $\e{\rs}{\rs}$ over the access channel.
	The estimated power ($\eprcvd$) over the interference channel induces variations in controlled power defined as $\epreg$. Following the relation between the controlled power at the ST and the received power at the PR 
\begin{align}
\eprcvdpr  = \hpo \epreg,
\label{eq:eprcvdpr}
\end{align}
the variations in $\epreg$ translate to the variations in $\prcvdpr$ (defined as $\eprcvdpr$) around $\ite$, which result in excessive interference at the PR. Unless captured, these variations may severely degrade the performance of the US. Besides this, due to the relationship between between the controlled power and the secondary throughput defined in (\ref{eq:sthr}), a certain amount of the variations are further translated to the secondary throughput. These variations in the system parameters ($\eprcvd$, $\epreg$, $\eprcvdpr$ and $\ers$) are characterized in terms of their probability density functions (pdfs).  
	\item In particular, the pdf of $\eprcvdpr$ is utilized to employ an interference constraint (also referred as confidence probability constraint) in terms of confidence probability $\pco$ at the ST such that the excessive interference at the PR can be regulated. In addition, by utilizing the pdf of $\ers$, the performance of the access channel is determined in terms of the expected secondary throughput. Finally, subject to the interference constraint on the confidence probability the performance of the US is jointly characterized in terms of a tradeoff between the estimation time and the secondary throughput tradoff. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Characterization of the System Parameters}
In order to capture the variations induced due to channel estimation, the pdfs of the aforementioned system parameters ($\eprcvd$, $\epreg$, $\eprcvdpr$, $\ers$) are characterized, subsequently. 

In accordance to the employed signal model, $\prcvd$ is modeled as a non-central chi-squared distribution $\ncchi2$, whose pdf is characterized as \cite{Char99}
\begin{equation}
	\label{nxc2equ}
	\dprcvd (x) = 
	\frac{N}{2\sigma_\textrm{p}^2} \left(\frac{N x}{\lambda}\right)^\frac{N-2}{4}  
	\exp\left(-\frac{N x+\lambda}{2\sigma_\textrm{p}^2}\right)  I_{\frac{N}{2}-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{N x\lambda}}{\sigma_\textrm{p}^2}\right) \;  ,
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the degree of freedom and also the number of samples used for the estimation, $\npp$ is the noise variance of the in-phase or quadrature-phase component of the received pilot signal ($\yrcvd[n]$, refer to \ref{eq:sys_mod_st}), and $I_{\frac{N}{2}-1}(\cdot)$ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order $\frac{N}{2}-1$ \cite{Jef00}. Furthermore, the non-centrality parameter is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\label{lambda}
	\lambda = \sum_{n=1}^N |\mathbb{E}[|\yrcvd[n]|^2] = N \times A^2
\end{equation}
The simplification in (\ref{lambda}) is explained as follows: a sinusoidal signal that represents a pilot signal consists of a constant amplitude, which is down-converted by an I/Q demodulator at the ST. In this regard, the complex samples $\yrcvd[n]$ have a constant envelope of value $A$. 

Corresponding to (\ref{eq:preg}), $\epreg$ follows an inverse non-central chi-squared distribution. The pdf for $\epreg$  is given by
\begin{align}
\dpreg(x) =& \frac{N K \ite}{2\npp x^2} e^{- \frac{N}{2 \npp}\left( \frac{K  \ite}{x} + \gpo \ptran \right)} \left( \frac{K \ite}{x \gpo \ptran}   \right)^{\frac{N}{4} - \frac{1}{2}} \label{eq:dpreg_pl} \times \\
\quad & I_{\frac{N}{2}  - 1}\left( \frac{N}{\npp} \sqrt{\frac{ K \ite \gpo \ptran}{x}}  \right). \nonumber
%\fpreg(x) = \q{\frac{N}{2} - 1}{\sqrt{\frac{N \ptran \ap}{\npp}},\sqrt{\frac{N \cdot x}{\npp}} }, 
\end{align}
%where $\q{\frac{N}{2} - 1}{\cdot, \cdot}$ is the Marcum-Q function \cite{grad}.
%where $I_{\frac{N}{2}  - 1}(\cdot)$ represents the Bessel function of order $\frac{N}{2} - 1$ \cite{grad}.

Following the relation in (\ref{eq:eprcvdpr}) and substituting $\dpreg(x)$ defined in (\ref{eq:dpreg_pl}), the pdf of $\eprcvdpr$ is determined as 
\begin{align}
\dprcvdpr(x) =& \frac{\ap N K \ite}{2\npp x^2} e^{- \frac{N \ap}{2 \npp}\left( \frac{K  \ite}{x} + \ptran \right)} \left( \frac{K \ite}{x \ptran}   \right)^{\frac{N}{4} - \frac{1}{2}} \times \label{eq:dpp_pl} \\
\quad & I_{\frac{N}{2}  - 1}\left( \frac{N \ap}{\npp} \sqrt{\frac{ K \ite \ptran}{x}}  \right). \nonumber
\end{align}

%The definition of $P_\textrm{c}$ can be retrieved from \cite{Kaushik15}. 
Consequently, the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of $\eprcvdpr$ is given by %\footnote{In \cite{Kaushik15}, we discovered a small typing error in the cdf of $P_\textrm{p}$, in this paper, we present the exact version of it.}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:cdf}
	\fprcvdpr(x) = Q_{\frac{N}{2}}\left(\sqrt{\frac{N P_\textrm{tran} \alpha_\textrm{p}}{\sigma_\textrm{p}^2}},\sqrt{\frac{N \alpha_\textrm{p} \theta_\textrm{I} K}{\sigma_\textrm{p}^2 x}}\right) \;  ,
\end{equation}
where $Q_{\frac{N}{2}}(\cdot)$ is the Marcum Q-function \cite{Jef00}.

%The system variables $P_\textrm{cont}$, $P_\textrm{p}$, and $R_\textrm{s}$ are derived from $P_\textrm{rcvd}$ in \cite{Kaushik15}, where the respective pdfs $f_{P_\textrm{cont}}(\cdot)$ and $f_{P_\textrm{p}}(\cdot)$ are also provided. In \cite{Kaushik15}, $f_{R_\textrm{s}}(\cdot)$ represented a pdf of the capacity. Here, we modify this expression to determine the pdf of the secondary throughput
Next, the pdf of the secondary throughput $\rs$ is determined as
\begin{equation}
	\label{Rspdf}
	\drs \left(x\right) =
	\frac{T}{T-\test}\frac{N K \theta_\textrm{I} \alpha_\textrm{s} \ln{2}}{2 \sigma_\textrm{p}^2 \sigma_\textrm{s}^2} 
	\left(\frac{p\left(x\right)+1}{\left[p\left(x\right)\right]^2} \right)
	e^{-\frac{N}{2 \sigma_\textrm{p}^2} \left(\frac{K \theta_\textrm{I} \alpha_\textrm{s}}{p\left(x\right)\sigma_\textrm{s}^2} + \alpha_\textrm{p} P_\textrm{tran} \right)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
	\times \left(\frac{K \theta_\textrm{I} \alpha_\textrm{s}}{p\left(x\right) \alpha_\textrm{p} P_\textrm{tran}\sigma_\textrm{s}^2}\right)^{\frac{N}{4}-\frac{1}{2}}
	I_{\frac{N}{2}-1}\left(\frac{N}{\sigma_\textrm{p}^2}\sqrt{\frac{K \theta_\textrm{I} \alpha_\textrm{p} P_\textrm{tran} \alpha_\textrm{s}}{p\left(x\right) \sigma_\textrm{s}^2}}\right) \;  ,
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\text{with } p\left(x\right) = 2^\frac{Tx}{T-\test}-1 \;  .
\end{equation*} 




\subsection{Estimation-Throughput Tradeoff}
Following the estimation theory, it is clear that small $\test$ results in large variations for the $\eprcvdpr$, and subsequently results in the deviation of $\eprcvdpr$ from $\ite$. If not considered, these variations may affect the performance of the US. To capture these variations, an interference constraint defined in terms of a confidence probability $\pco$ and an accuracy $\mu$\footnote{In order to scale the confidence interval relative to $\ite$.} is proposed. In order to restrict the excessive interference due to channel estimation, it is important to restrain $\pco$ above a certain desired level $\pcod$ for a fixed value of $\mu$. In this regard, the interference constraint is defined as
\begin{align}
\pco = \fprcvdpr \left( {(1 + \mu) \ite}\right)  - \fprcvdpr \left({(1 - \mu) \ite} \right) \ge \pcod, \label{eq:pc} 
\end{align}
where $\left( {(1 + \mu) \ite}\right)$ and $\left({(1 - \mu) \ite} \right)$ represent the confidence interval around $\ite$. According to (\ref{eq:pc}), the confidence probability can be computed by inserting confidence interval in $\fprcvdpr(x)$, which is defined in (\ref{eq:cdf}). It is worthy to note that $\pco$ depends on $\test$, through $\fprcvdpr(x)$. Besides this, $\e{\ers}{\ers}$ is also related to the estimation time. Hence, from the design perspective, it is essential to select the estimation time appropriately such that the ST the maximum secondary throughput is achieved and the interference constraint is satisfied simultaneously. This relationship is characterized as \textit{estimation-throughput tradeoff} is given by 

%Clearly, there exits a tradeoff that involves maximizing the expected throughput at the SR subject to a probability of confidence constraint given by
\begin{align}
\e{\ers}{\ers(\ttest)} = \maxi_{\test}  & \text{      } \e{\ers}{\ers(\test)} 
 \label{eq:sys} \\
\text{s.t.} & (\ref{eq:pc}). \nonumber  
\end{align}
According to this tradeoff, there exists a suitable estimation time $\ttest$ that satisfies the interference constraint and maximizes the expected secondary throughput. 

\section{Validation}

\end{figure}


\figurename~\ref{messaufbau} presents the experimental setup deployed for performing the validation process. It has been previously claimed that the experimental validation considers the deterministic behaviour of the channel. With the employment of the transmit and the receive antennas the interference signal received\footnote{The experiments were performed over the ISM bands with center frequency fixed at \SI{2.45}{GHz}, an interference signal from the operational wireless LAN was observed within the band of interest (in-band) or as an out-of-band emissions from the neighbouring channels.} at the ST can influence the measurements, thereby resulting in the deviation of the empirical results from their analytical counterpart. To avoid this issue, the interference channel is implemented by means of a coaxial cable. In addition, attenuators are used to realize different values of $\snrrcvd$. The use of the coaxial cable is limited to the validation process, later of the deployed of the demonstrator, the coaxial cable is replaced with antennas. %By doing so, we were able to acquire a large number of system variable realizations measured under similar conditions, which we needed for validating the stochastic model. 

The CSC-BS/ST is emulated using a Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRP) B210, a software defined radio, from Ettus Research \cite{Ettus} and a host computer, which is connected to the USRP by means of USB cable. The host computer performs the following tasks: (i) it enables the access to the USRP by controlling certain Radio frequency (RF) parameters such as, center frequency and sampling frequency, (ii) it allows the baseband processing over the complex samples. %Since the characterization of the system parameters, which is associated with the power control is implemented at the ST, therefore it is reasonable to deploy only ST for the validation process. 
The PR is realized using a Rhode $\&$ Schwarz 200A vector signal generator (again, later for the implementation of the demonstrator, the signal generator emulating the PR is replaced with an USRP and a host computer, like the ST). Since the USRP employs a homodyne receiver\footnote{A homodyne receiver implements a direct down conversion of the bandpass to the baseband signal.}, spurious effects such as DC offset, flicker noise $(1/f)$ and I/Q imbalance arising from the analog front-end can influence the validation process. These spurious effects, particularly, the DC offset and the flicker noise become significant at low signal to noise ratio. 

In oder to retrieve the complex samples close to the one obtained while characterizing the system model (which does not take such spurious effects into account), following signal processing is proposed at the host computer.\begin{itemize}
\item The received signal is oversampled with sampling frequency $200$ $\SI{}{KHz}$. 
%Now, for a bandpass filter with bandpass frequency of $\SI{50}{KHz}$ applied subsequently, this sampling corresponds to a oversampling factor = 4. 
To filter out the spurious effects, the local oscillator is tunned at a certain offset frequency defined as $\flo = \SI{50}{KHz}$, refer to \figurename~\ref{fig:SP_os}. 
\item Subsequently, a bandpass filter (with bandwidth = $\SI{50}{KHz}$, this corresponds to a oversampling factor = $4$) is employed to obtain the desired bandpass signal at the $\flo$. This filters out the DC offset and the flicker noise present at low frequencies, cf. \figurename~\ref{fig:SP_bp}. 
\item In order to obtain the low pass equivalent of the desired signal, a digital down conversion\footnote{Multiplying with a complex sinusoid with frequency $\flo$.} of the bandpass filtered signal is performed, cf. \figurename~\ref{fig:SP_dc}. %These four steps depicted in \figurename~\ref{fig:SP} are carried out to remove the receiver's DC offset and the flicker noise (1/f) around the DC. Due to the small bandwidth of the pilot signal, these effects form the bottleneck of our validation and had to be accounted for. 
\item In the end, decimation filter is applied (decimation factor = 4) over the down converted signal, cf. \figurename~\ref{fig:SP_de}. This is done to reduce the correlation between the samples due to oversampling, since the proposed framework considers independent and identically distributed samples while characterizing the pdfs of the corresponding systems parameters. 
\end{itemize}

Besides these spurious effects, it is challenging to accurately determine the noise power ($\sigma_\textrm{p}^2$), which characterizes the theoretical expressions. In this regard, an approximate value of $\sigma_\textrm{p}^2$ is determined using the variance of the envelope of $\yrcvd[n]$. This is done because the value of the noise power evaluated during the calibration (that involves no signal transmission) differed from the one determined while performance the measurements for different values of signal to noise ratio $\snrrcvd$ received at the ST over the interference channel. It is noticed that the latter approach (as presented later in Section \ref{ssec:val}) provided a closer fit to the analytical expressions.

Finally, to complement the validation process, the measurement data is analyzed offline using Matlab.

\subsection{Validation of System Parameters}

Since the stochastic model is the basis of the performance analysis of the proposed framework. It is reasonable to first validate the pdfs of the system variables $\eprcvd$, $\epreg$, $\eprcvdpr$, and $\ers$ derived in Section \ref{model}. To this end, measurements with the setup illustrated in \figurename~\ref{messaufbau} is performed. The measurement data is plotted in terms of histograms and scaled such that it represents the relative frequency ($f_\textrm{hist}[x]$), which are evaluated over a certain set of bins $x \in \mathcal X_\text{bins}$. \figurename~\ref{hrel_pdf} compares the histograms from the measurements and pdfs determined using the analytical expressions for a certain set system parameters depicted in Table \ref{param}. The plots show that the theoretical expressions are valid and can be employed for capturing the performance of the CR systems operating under realistic situations.

The experiments were repeated for different values of $\snrrcvd$. It was observed that for a considerable range of $\snrrcvd \in (4,30)\SI{}{dB}$, the theoretical expressions depicted a significant accuracy to the experimental data, refer to Table \ref{nichtzentral}. The accuracy was quantified in terms of relative error defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{fr}
\epsilon = \frac{1}{|\mathcal X\sub{bins}|} \times \sum_{x \in \mathcal X\sub{bins}} \frac{\dprcvd(x) - f\sub{hist}[x]}{f\sub{hist}[x]} \;  , 
\end{equation}
$|\mathcal X\sub{bins}|$ represents the cardinality of $\mathcal X\sub{bins}$, which excludes the bins with $f\sub{hist}[x] \neq 0$. Different values of $\snrrcvd$ can be translated to different channel conditions, hence, this observation further concludes that the proposed framework is robust to the fluctuations in the channel gain.

\subsection{Validation of the Estimation-Throughput Tradeoff}
Following the validation of the pdfs that captures the variations in the system parameters, it is interesting to validate the performance of the CR system in terms of the estimation-throughput tradeoff, characterized in (\ref{eq:sys}). Thus, the feasibility of the optimization problem that yields a suitable estimation time and satisfies the interference constraint on $\pco$ and maximizes the achievable throughput is validated by means of hardware. As discussed previously, a large $\test$ improves the performance of the primary system by reducing the variations in $\eprcvdpr$, depicted in terms of an increase in $\pco$, cf. \figurename~\ref{RspocstricheA}. From the perspective of the secondary system, the increase in $\test$ reduces the achievable secondary throughput. These variations of the expected throughput $\e{\ers}{\ers}$ and the confidence probability $\pco$ versus the estimation time $\test$ are depicted \figurename~\ref{RspocstricheA}, which illustrates a joint validation of the performance of a underlay CR system. Again, the validation is achieved by comparing the mesurements of the performance parameters ($\e{\ers}{\ers}$ and $\pco$) with their analytical expressions for different $\test$. In contrast to the analytical framework presented in Section \ref{model}, the measurements of $\pco$ are determined by computing a numerical integration in the region within the confidence interval $(1  \pm \mu)  \theta_\textrm{I}$, cf. \figurename~\ref{hrel_pdf}.

	%\vspace{-10 pt}
\end{figure}

After performing the validation described in this section, following conclusions can be outlined: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The accuracy of the derived expressions and the feasibility of the received power-based estimation (proposed and investigated in this and previous chapters) have been jsutified by means of the hardware.
\item Furthermore, the applicability of the simplifications and solutions proposed, cf. Section \ref{ssec:simp1}, to perform the validation process has been accounted.    
\end{itemize}
Hence, the analytical framework proposed is capable of illustrating the underlay principle by means of a demonstrator.

\section{Implementation of a Demonstrator}
\label{demo}
Although the validation is an important part of the system design, it considers an offline verification of the proposed approach. From a deployment perspective, it is interesting to demonstrate the online operation of the underlay paradigm on a real hardware. This section provides the insights and outline the involved challenges while deploying the proposed approach in the form of a demonstrator. In the thesis, the operation of CR systems at a suitable estimation time that is associated with the maximum secondary throughput has been analyzed, which represents the optimum performance of a CR system. However, in practice, it is difficult to determine the value of this parameter while the system is operating (\textit{on the fly}). In this regard, the subsequent section discusses this challenging task and proposes a heuristic approach of determining the estimation time. 

\subsection{Estimation Time}
\label{esttime}
The analytical expression (\ref{eq:sys}) and \figurename~\ref{RspocstricheA} illustrate a dependency of the performance parameters ($\pco$ and $\e{\ers}{\ers}$) on the estimation time $\test$. This dependency (depicted as the estimation-throughput tradeoff) is utilized to determine the suitable estimation time $\ttest$ that achieves the maximum secondary throughput. However, $\ttest$ can be determined for a certain value of the $\snrrcvd$ (for a given channel gain). In practice, the mobility of the ST or the PR, or the surroundings objects can affect the channel gain, and consequently the received $\snrrcvd$. Under this situation, it is challenging to select $\ttest$ such that the system adheres to the interference constraint and still achieves the maximum secondary throughput for the corresponding values of $\snrrcvd$. To approach this issue, the variation of $\ttest$ for a certain range of $\snrrcvd$ and different values of the confidence probability constraint $\pcod \in \{0.90, 0.95, 0.99\}$ is investigated\footnote{Such investigations can be performed during the validation process, which is normally included at the system design.}, cf. \figurename~\ref{fig:Tausnr}. %a new parameter called the estimation time ($\testo$) is introduced. It is $\test$ that maximizes the secondary throughput according to (\ref{eq:}) in \cite{Kaushik15} for a certain value of $\snrrcvd$, $\mu$ and a target value of $P_\textrm{c}$ defined as $\bar{P_\textrm{c}}$. In Fig. \ref{RspocstricheA}, this optimization process is indicated graphically by the dotted lines, where, from a fixed $\bar{P_\textrm{c}} = 0.95$, we acquire $\tau_\textrm{opt} \approx \SI{0.75}{ms}$, which corresponds to $\mathbb{E}\left[R_\textrm{s}\right] \approx \SI{7.02}{bits/s/Hz}$.

%However, this analysis is carried out for a fixed value of $\snrrcvd$. Under real conditions, due to channel fading, $\snrrcvd$ is not known. In this sense, it is not possible to determine $\tau_\textrm{opt}$. To resolve this issue, we propose a procedure, whereby we analyze the variations of $\tau_\textrm{opt}$ for different values of $\snrrcvd$, refer to Fig. \ref{Tausnr}, and select $\tau_\textrm{opt}$'s maximum value. 
Based on this analysis, the maximum value of the suitable estimation time $\ttesto = \maxi\{ \ttest | \snrrcvd \in \{-10,20 \}\SI{}{dB} \}$ is selected as the estimation time for the demonstrator.  
By doing this, it is assured that the interference constraint is satisfied for different realizations of the channel gain, which correspond to $\snrrcvd \in \{-10,20\}\SI{}{dB}$. 
%In addition, we consider different values of $\bar{P_\textrm{c}}$.

	\label{fig:Tausnr}
	%\vspace{-10 pt}
\end{figure}
From \figurename~\ref{fig:Tausnr}, it is further observed that $\ttest$ decreases with $\snrrcvd$ and attains saturation below a certain $\snrrcvd$. %\footnote{For varying $\theta_\textrm{I}$, while the shape of the curves changed slightly, the upper limits for $\tau_\textrm{opt}$ remained constant.} 
This behaviour can be explained as follows: For large values of $\snrrcvd$, $\preg$ is low, hence reduces the variations of $\eprcvdpr$ around $\ite$ and consequently a lower value of $\ttest$ is needed to maintain these variations within the confidence interval. On the other hand, the signal received with low $\snrrcvd$, which correspond to a higher $\preg$, however, considering the limited number of samples used for the estimation process and sensitivity of the deployed hardware (USRP), it is difficult to distinguish these signal from the noise. This is why, $\ttest$ saturates below a certain $\snrrcvd$. However, increasing the number of samples for the channel estimation or selecting a hardware with higher sensitivity extend the saturation region to the lower $\snrrcvd$. 

In the end, this analysis can be used for determining $\ttesto$ in the implementation of our demonstrator. Since the confidence probability constraint $\pcod = 0.95$ is targeted, $\ttesto = \SI{24}{ms}$ is chosen to be estimation time for the channel estimation, cf. \figurename~\ref{fig:Tausnr}. With this, the interference constraint is satisfied for all $\snrrcvd$ at the cost of a decreased performance in terms of the expected secondary throughput, particularly for the situation with high $\snrrcvd$, which corresponds to low value of the suitable estimation time.


\subsection{Simplifications}
\label{ssec:simp2}
In order to successfully deploy the demonstrator, in addition to the simplifications proposed for the hardware validation in Section \ref{ssec:simp2}, following simplifications are accounted in the system model: 
%The main objective of this section is to demonstrate the basic principle of an underlay scenario, in view of this, the following reasonable simplifications in the proposed analytical framework is considered:

\begin{enumerate}
	%\item The hardware implementation of the SR is not considered, that is, it is regarded virtual in the system (refer to Fig. \ref{demo_blockA}).
	\item According the proposed framework the controlled power can be evaluated using (\ref{eq:preg}). However, it requires knowledge of the scaling parameter $K$, which further requires the computation of the expected received power $\e{\eprcvd}{\eprcvd}$. Again analog to estimation time, it is difficult to carry out such a computation while the system is operating. To resolve this issue, the control power is computed based on a single realization of the $\eprcvd$ for the demonstrator. Such a simplification, however, increases the variation in the system. As a result, a certain deviation in the performance depicted by the demonstrator (in terms of the confidence probability and expected secondary throughput) from the one computed using the theoretical expression is expected. 
In this regard, the estimated channel gain, evaluated from $\eprcvd$, is determined as 
	\begin{equation}
		\epgpo = \frac{\e{\eprcvd}{\eprcvd}-\npp}{\ptran} \approx \frac{\eprcvd-\npp}{\ptran}. 
		\label{eq:approx1}
	\end{equation}	
As $\npp$ is negligible compared to $\eprcvd$, (\ref{eq:approx1}) can be further simplified as 
	\begin{equation}
		\epgpo = \frac{\eprcvd-\npp}{\ptran} \approx \frac{\eprcvd}{\ptran}.
		\label{eq:approx2}
	\end{equation}	
	\item Furthermore, the analytical framework employs a TDD, hence, assumes a perfect frame synchronization between the PR and the ST. Since, the synchronization between two different systems is challenging\footnote{It is cumbersome to deploy two different system and realize TDD for the preliminary analysis.}. To simplify this matter, Frequency Division Duplexing between the PR and the ST is proposed as follows: The signals are transmitted and received using two different frequencies (\SI{2.422}{GHz} and \SI{2.423}{GHz}) over two separate antennas, as illustrated in \figurename~\ref{demo_blockA}. With this technique, the channel reciprocity may be compromised.	
\end{enumerate}
In order to realize these simplifications, it is utmost necessary to observe the impact of these simplifications on the performance of the demonstrator, specially, in terms of the violation of the interference constraint.

	\label{demo_blockA}
	%\vspace{-10 pt}
\end{figure}
In this regard, the principle operation of the underlay paradigm described in Section \ref{scenario} is mapped onto the hardware and the above mentioned simplifications are applied. The signal flow is illustrated in \figurename~\ref{demo_blockA} is depicted. The techniques such as the channel estimation (received power-based estimation), the power control mechanism, the interference constraint are implemented over the host computer using GNU Radio and the available signal processing blocks therein.


\subsection{User Interaction and Observations}

\figurename~\ref{interface} presents the graphical user interfaces of the demonstrator that provides insights to the parameters evaluated at the PR (which include, $\prcvdpr$ and $\pco$) and the ST (which include, $\eprcvd$, $\epreg$, and $\ers$). A hardware calibration of the demonstrator is performed to provide physical significance to the digital values obtained from the USRPs. Because the SR has not been implemented over the hardware, a slider to modify the gain for the access channel ($\gs$) has been in employed to demostrate the effect of variations in the $\gs$ on the performance of the system. %$R_\textrm{s}$ is affected by changing the value of $\alpha_\textrm{s}$ or $T$. 

As expected, upon changing the value of $\ite$ at the ST causes the variations in the measurements of $\eprcvdpr$ at the PR to shift approximately to the same value. This indicates the expected receiver power $\e{\prcvdpr}{\prcvdpr}$ is fixed to the interference temperature, as proposed in the analytical framework. A snapshop of this phenomenon is presented in \figurename~\ref{interface}. In addition, due to the modification of the interference constraint\footnote{Changing the interference temperature changes the confidence interval.}, the ST adapts its $\preg$ according to the new parameters that define the interference constraint. The change in the $\preg$ further changes the expected secondary throughput $\e{\ers}{\ers}$. These observations demonstrate that the received power-based estimation (to acquire channel knowledge) implemented at the ST by listening to the pilot signal transmitted by the PR to perform the power control mechanism is operating in accordance to the underlay principle. Finally, the response of the demonstrator to the dynamic conditions can be analyzed by varying the distance, thereby varying the channel gain for the link between the PR and the ST. The effect can be captured by observing the changes in $\eprcvd$ and other corresponding parameters that depend on $\hpo$. As the distance is increased beyond a certain value, the ST operates at its maximum transmit power. This event is indicated in graphical the user interface.

For the given accuracy $\mu = 0.05$, it is observed that the demonstrator fails to achieve the target value of the confidence probability constraint $\pcod = 0.95$. Certainly, this issue is largely caused due to the simplifications undertaken in Section \ref{ssec:simp2}. In future, it is important to relax these simplifications. Another possible reason for this kind of behaviour can be speculated as follows: Since a pilot signal produced by a signal generator has been used for the hardware validation, which offers a higher signal quality than the one produced by a USRP in the demonstrator. 
%Moreover, because of the separate links for sensing and transmission and the frequency separation of \SI{1}{MHz}, the channel reciprocity of the demonstrator may be compromised compared with the theoretical model. 
In order to sustain the proposed interference constraint, the tolerance limit is increased to $\mu = 0.20$. As a result, the confidence probability reaches the target value $\pco = 0.95$, thereby satisfying the interference constraint, refer to \figurename~\ref{interface} the PR interface. Despite this deviation from the theoretical behaviour, it can be concluded that the USRPs considered for the deployment of the demonstrator represent the viable choice for signal transmissions. More importantly, the deployed presents the following conclusions: \begin{itemize} \item it demonstrates the principle operation of an US that employs a power control mechanism at the ST and limits the excessive interference at the PR by employing an interference constraint. \item it further illustrates the capability of adapting to the changes in the environment in terms of channel between the ST and the PR.  \end{itemize}

\section{Summary}
\label{con}

In this chapter, the performance of an underlay system from a deployment perspective has been analyzed. To this end, an analytical framework has been validated by means of hardware measurements. 
%In this regard, the validation of a stochastic model that incorporates the pdfs of the system parameters has been considered. In addition, the performance analysis in terms of estimation-throughput tradeoff has been validated. 
Following the main motivation of the thesis, it has been argued that the knowledge of the interacting channels is absolutely necessary for the deployment of CR systems. 
Based on this validation process, it has been indicated that the proposed framework that incorporates the channel estimation technique, such as received power-based estimation for the link between the primary and secondary systems, is realistic (lowers the complexity and assures the versatility to unknown primary user signals) for the hardware deployment. Following the experimental validation, a hardware demonstrator that depicts the principle working of the underlay system has been proposed. More importantly, in this chapter, the hardware challenges considered while deploying the demonstrator have been briefly discussed and consequently the corresponding solutions and simplifications have been proposed.  


%In the future, we intend to reconsider certain simplifications made while deploying the demonstrator, for instance, we propose to deploy a USRP for the SR and try to synchronize the frame structure at the ST and the PR in order to respect channel reciprocity.

%\subsection{System model}
%CR models the channel coefficients $h_\text{p}$, $h_\text{s}$, using Rayleigh or Nakagami-$m$ distribution for the indoor-indoor and indoor-outdoor links. In literature, Rayleigh distribution is mostly preferred due to its analytical tractability. In contrast to that, Nakagami-$m$ accounts for the severity in fading through $m$ parameter, thus, it is more applicable in indoor scenarios. For a fixed transmit power at CR, the received signal to noise power $\gamma$\footnote{Consider a transmission from a certain CR, then $\gamma$ is equivalent to signal to noise ratio (SNR) at ID and interference to noise ratio at PR. Therefore, the term SNR is not used to avoid confusion thereof. Moreover, the interference from unintended primary transmitters and other CRs at PR or ID is treated as white noise.} at PR or ID, corresponding to Rayleigh case, follows exponential distribution \cite{simon2005}
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:expo}
%F_{\gamma}(\gamma) = 1 - e^{- \frac{\gamma}{\bar{\gamma}} }
%\end{equation}
%and for Nakagami-$m$, it follows Gamma distribution \cite{simon2005}
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:gamma}
%F_{\gamma}(\gamma) = 1 - \frac{ \Gamma{ \left( m, m \frac{\gamma}{\bar{\gamma}} \right) }}{\Gamma(m)},
%\end{equation}
%where $\bar{\gamma} = \mathbb{E}[\gamma]$ and $m$ denotes the shape parameter. $\Gamma(\cdot)$ and $\Gamma(\cdot,\cdot)$ are the complete and incomplete Gamma functions.
