\chapter{Notations and Symbols}

Please note that, there exists certain notations that are specific or follow a slightly different definition corresponding to the underlying cognitive radio system (interweave system (IS), underlay system (US) and hybrid system (HS)). In both the cases, such notations have been outlined by their underlying systems.
