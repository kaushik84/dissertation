\makelettertitle
I recently graduated with a Doctor's degree (Dr.\,-Ing.) in electrical engineering from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany. My doctoral thesis primarily focuses on cognitive radio that presents an alternative approach of resolving spectrum scarcity for the upcoming 5G networks, by opportunistically accessing the licensed spectrum. As a result, a significant part of my research was associated with the statistical learning of the access behavior for the licensed users. More importantly, I have been able to justify my theoretical findings by means of implementation. 
Besides research, I successfully participated in a BMBF (German Federal Ministry of Research and Education) project, supervised master and bachelor theses, held tutorials and laboratory during the semester. 

%For four years and seven months, I have worked for Leica Camera AG in the department of digital imaging on data compression and their container formats. During this period, I was able to extend my knowledge on the work-flow of image data for modern digital cameras. Here, I developed an algorithm for lossless compression of RAW images using context adaptive Huffman codes which is now used in the new line of digital cameras.

Since I am highly interested in research and development associated with statistical learning, I believe starting as a Data Scientist at SAP would be the next logical step for me. I am approaching you in this matter because your group is focused on implementation of machine learning techniques, which is related to my education background and interests. Besides, I am attracted towards the fact that the mentioned job position provides me an opportunity to develop and deploy machine learning models. 
It is worthy to mention here that I have up-to-date knowledge of the deep learning frameworks, such as neural networks and reinforcement learning. In particular, in context of my research, I have deployed statistical learning and reinforcement learning algorithms. Apart from this, based on my industrial experience, I have profound knowledge of image and video data sets.   
%Despite the fact that my experience has been confined mostly to the wireless communications, I am willing extend my knowledge to technologies related to satellite navigation, as mentioned in the job description.

As far as the German language is concerned, I have acquired B1 certification and also possess the capacity to express my views in a clear fashion. Apart from my professional interest, I believe working at SAP is beneficial for me from a personal perspective, as my wife Mini Kaushik will start at SAP from April 2017. 

I would like to contribute to the ongoing development at SAP and hope that my profile fits to your group. I am looking forward to hearing from you.
