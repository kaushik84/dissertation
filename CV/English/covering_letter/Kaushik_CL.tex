\makelettertitle
I will be graduating with a Doctor's degree (Dr.Ing.) in Electrical Engineering in January 2017 from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany. My doctoral thesis primarily focuses on Cognitive Radio that presents an alternative approach of resolving spectrum scarcity for the upcoming 5G networks, by opportunistically accessing the licensed spectrum. As a part of my research, I have been able to justify my theoretical findings by means of hardware implementation (a software defined platform). Besides research, I successfully participated in a BMBF (Germen Federal Ministry of Research and Education) project, supervised Master and Bachelor thesis, held tutorials and laboratory during the semester. 

For four years and seven months, I have worked for Leica Camera AG in the department of digital imaging on data compression and their container formats. During this period, I was able to extend my knowledge on the work-flow of image data for modern digital cameras. Here, I developed an algorithm for lossless compression of RAW images using context adaptive Huffman codes which is now used in the new line of digital cameras.

Since I am highly interested in research and development related to digital signal processing, I believe starting as an engineer at BMW would be a great opportunity step for me. I am approaching you in this matter because your workgroup is focussed on processing associated with control theory, prediction, reinforcement learning, which are related to my educational background and interests. Besides, I am excited about the fact that the mentioned job position provides me an opportunity to develop and implement algorithms for the automotive industry. Despite the fact that my experience has been applicable to the wireless technologies, I believe I have the capacity to extend my knowledge in the robotics field.

I would like to contribute to the ongoing development at BMW and hope that my profile fits to your workgroup. I am looking forward to hearing from you.
