I recently graduated with a Doctorâ€™s degree (Dr. -Ing.) in electrical engineering from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany. My doctoral thesis primarily focuses on cognitive radio that presents an alternative approach of resolving spectrum scarcity for the upcoming 5G networks, by opportunistically accessing the licensed spectrum. As a result, a significant part of my research was associated with the stochastic modeling of the access behavior for the licensed users. More importantly, I have been able to justify my theoretical findings by means of implementation. Besides research, I successfully participated in a BMBF (German Federal Ministry of Research and Education) project, supervised master and bachelor theses, held tutorials and laboratory during the semesters. My current research is focused on the application of the Bayesian learning models to the cognitive radio and caching scenarios.

Since I am highly interested in research and development associated with machine learning, I believe starting as a researcher at Bosch Center of Artificial Intelligence would be the next logical step for me. I am approaching you in this matter because your group is focused on the machine learning techniques, which is well-related to my education background and research interests. Besides, I am attracted towards the fact that the mentioned job position provides me an opportunity to present the major findings in the form of patents and publications. 


It is worthy to mention here that, as a part of my research experience, I believe I possess a broader perspective of different machine learning models and the associated optimization problems, the prerequisites stated in job description. Having said that, I am willing to strengthen my knowledge towards probabilistic graphical and latent variable modeling.

I would like to contribute to the ongoing research at Bosch and hope that my profile fits to your group. I am looking forward to hearing from you.
