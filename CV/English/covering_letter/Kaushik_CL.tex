\makelettertitle
I recently graduated with a Doctor's degree (Dr.\,-Ing.) in electrical engineering from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. My doctoral thesis primarily focuses on Cognitive Radio that presents an alternative approach of resolving spectrum scarcity for the upcoming 5G networks, by opportunistically accessing the licensed spectrum. As a part of my research, I have been able to justify my theoretical findings by means of hardware implementation. Besides research, I successfully participated in a BMBF (German Federal Ministry of Research and Education) project, supervised master and bachelor thesis, held tutorials and laboratory during the academic semesters. 


Since I am highly interested in research and development related to signal processing, I believe starting as an acoustics systems engineer at HARMAN would be the next logical step for me. I am approaching you in this matter because workgroup is working on signal processing techniques in relation to active noise control, which is related to my educational background and interests. Besides, I am excited about the fact that the mentioned position demands design and development of noise cancellation systems for the automotive industry. I would like to mention here that I have advanced programming knowledge and familiarity with the laboratory equipment, as stated in the job description. Despite the fact that my signal processing experience has been applicable to the wireless communications, I am willing to extend my knowledge in the field of acoustics engineering. 

I would like to contribute to the ongoing research and development at HARMAN and hope that my profile fits to your workgroup. I am looking forward to hearing from you.
